# Personal Statement - Fangzhi Su

As I approach the completion of my Psychology degree at the University of Bristol, I'm excited to apply for the Management Trainee position at Nelson China during my current gap year. My journey through academia and practical experiences has equipped me with a unique blend of skills that I believe will be valuable in this role.

My time in the UK has been rich with opportunities for growth, both academically and professionally. One of the most rewarding experiences was co-founding a "script murder" business - a tabletop role-playing game, along with my senior fellows. This non-trivial startup idea ends up with a burst in influx of my life. It taught me how to spot market opportunities and cater to the specific needs of Chinese international students in a foreign environment. Through this experience, I developed stronger business instincts, leadership capabilities, and cross-cultural communication skills – all of which are crucial for a management trainee.

My psychology studies have deeply influenced my approach to both academic and extracurricular pursuits. I've had the opportunity to apply this knowledge in meaningful ways, particularly through my collaboration with the Bristol Chinese Students and Scholars Association. In this role, I helped bridge the communication gap between Chinese students needing mental health support and the university's Student Health Service (SHS). This involved not just initiating conversations but also following up on students' progress, showcasing my ability to handle sensitive situations with empathy and professionalism.

Throughout my university years, I've been passionate about promoting mental health awareness among my peers. This initiative has allowed me to develop strong interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence, while also creating supportive environments – qualities that I believe are essential in any management position.

Currently in my gap year, I have the flexibility to fully dedicate to a full-time, on-site position. This means I am committed entirely to the role at Nelson China. I'm eager to bring my combination of psychology expertise, entrepreneurial experience, and commitment to personal and organizational growth. I believe I would bring myself and company desirable values and uplifting competence.
