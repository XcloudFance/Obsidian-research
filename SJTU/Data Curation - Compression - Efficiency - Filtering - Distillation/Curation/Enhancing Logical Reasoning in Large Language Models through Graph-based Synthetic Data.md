## Logical Graph
> [!PDF|red] [[logical reasoning.pdf#page=2&selection=19,7,46,19&color=red|logical reasoning, p.2]]
> > Let G=(V, E, R) represent a relational graph with a set of nodes V, a set of edges E between the nodes, and a set of relations R expressed in first-order logic. 


## Goal
generate synthetic examples of graphstructured data from such relation graphs to adapt LLMs for targeted reasoning tasks.

> [!NOTE] 目标
> 生成一个由关系型的图结构数据去加强LLM的逻辑推理能力

他们也一样构建了一个类似Synthetic Continued Pretraining的Entity
