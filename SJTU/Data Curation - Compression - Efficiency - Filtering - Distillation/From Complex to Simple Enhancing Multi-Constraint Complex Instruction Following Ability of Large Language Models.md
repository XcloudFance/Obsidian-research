## From Complex to Simple: Enhancing Multi-Constraint Complex Instruction Following Ability of Large Language Models

- 主要的主题是**Multi-constraint Complex Instruction**

- Effective Data的两种组成：atomic data & Compositional Data
- 1) Initially train models with atomic data, enabling them to **handle compositional data automatically.**
- (2) Train models with compositional data, enabling them to **understand instructions with atomic or varying compositions of constraints spontaneously**

  

- Story for Compositional Data
    - Training with compositional data **(usually 3 to 5 constraints)** boosts performance on instructions with 1 to 3 constraints significantly
