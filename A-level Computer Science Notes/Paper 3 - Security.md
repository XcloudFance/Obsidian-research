## Digital Signature
- authentication, non-repudiation, data integrity, confidentiality
- Hashing algorithm
	- Random File Access
	- Digest Calculation
- Digest is a value calculated from hashing the data to be sent
- Digest Why?
	- Source Authenticity - Asymmetric Encryption



## Asymmetric Encryption
- How to identify?
	- Using different keys to decrypt
	- Private keys held by two sides of senders and receivers to decrypt
