## Virtual Memory & Swap Memory
- Paging
- **Disk Thrashing** - produced by overutilizing swap memory from RAM to ROM - cause performance decrease
- When CPU needs to exceed the memory from RAM,  virtual memory extends the space to ROM so that CPU can access more available memory.
- Only swap the memory data when necessary.
- Virtual memory is created temporarily

## Logical Memory
- Paging



## Deep Learning
- Using Artificial Neural Network
- With hidden layers to learn the pattern that behaves like human brains
- and input output layers
- neurons - 神经元
- Deep learning is a specialised form of machine learning.

- Reason / 好处 / 为什么
- Deep learning systems enable machines to process data with a **nonlinear approach.**
- deal with unstructured data
