## Virtual Memory & Swap Memory
- Paging
- **Disk Thrashing** - produced by overutilizing swap memory from RAM to ROM - cause performance decrease
- When CPU needs to exceed the memory from RAM,  virtual memory extends the space to ROM so that CPU can access more available memory.
- Only swap the memory data when necessary.
- Virtual memory is created temporarily.
