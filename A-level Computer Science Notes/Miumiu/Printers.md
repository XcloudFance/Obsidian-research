- The **revolving drum** is initially **given an electrical charge** 旋转的光敏感的drum会首先印上图片和文字
- A laser beam (bounces off moving mirrors) scans **back and forth** across
the drum discharging certain points (i.e. ‘drawing’ the letters and images to be
printed as a pattern of electrical charges)   - 印上图片
- The drum is coated with oppositely charged toner (which only sticks to
charged areas) - toner是碳粉盒子，等会要吸附到纸张上
- The drum rolls over electro-statically charged paper // Electro-statically
charged paper is fed (towards the drum)
- The ‘pattern’ on the drum is transferred to the paper
- The paper is passed through the fuser to seal the image
- The electrical charge is removed from the drum // the excess toner is
collected
