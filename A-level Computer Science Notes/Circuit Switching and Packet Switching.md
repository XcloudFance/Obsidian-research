P1
Circuit switching uses a dedicated channel to make communication,
whereas packet switching forms data into packets to transmit over a
digital network.
MP2
The dedicated path for circuit switching must be established before
the transfer of data can commence, which is not the case with packet
switching (as it doesnâ€™t require a dedicated path).
MP3
**Data in packet switching is split into packets, in circuit switching the**
**message remains intact.**
MP4
**All of the transmission in circuit switching follows the same path**
**whereas different packets in packet switching can take different**
**routes**.
MP5
The message is received in the same order in which it is sent with
circuit switching, but with packet switching, the packets can be
received out of order (for assembly at the destination).
MP6
**Circuit switching is implemented at the physical layer while packet**
**switching is implemented at the network layer.**
MP7
Circuit switching uses the whole bandwidth of the channel used,
packet switching can share bandwidth.
MP8
**Circuit switching communication ends with an error but packet**
**switching allows packets to be re-sent.**
MP9
Circuit switching is a simpler process than packet switching


## RISC Pipelining
- Increase instruction throughput
- No two instruction can be executed at the same stage 
- One instruction is fetched while the previous instruction is decoded
- Allow instructions to be executed **concurrently** / Parallelly
-
