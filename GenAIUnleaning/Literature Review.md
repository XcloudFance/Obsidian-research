LPIPSu is calculated on unerased artists. A lower LPIPSu indicates a lesser impact on unrelated artists, where our method and UCE effectively maintains unrelated concepts. We also calculate the overall effectiveness  <br>by LPIPSd = LPIPSe − LPIPSu, which is the difference between erased and  <br>unerased artists. Our method performs best in this regard - artistic | FID score closely comparable to the topperforming UCE and the second-best SLD, both of which generates a considerably higher number of nude body parts.

We count  <br>the number of female and male nude body parts in the 4703 I2P images. As  <br>illustrated in Tab. 2, the nudity ratios between women and men almost decrease  <br>in every method, indicating an erasure bias on female information (excluding  <br>SA, which erases more sex-related concepts besides nudity [8]). We attribute  <br>this limitation to the inherent bias in the target concept "nudity" within SD,  <br>which tends to generate more female-oriented content. To investigate this bias,  <br>we randomly selected 20 seeds and employed SD V1.4 to generate 3 images per  <br>seed with the prompt "nudity", resulting in a total of 60 images. Surprisingly,  <br>almost all of these generated images depict female body part as presented in  <br>the last column of Tab. 2. Thus our derived embedding is also biased. Further  <br>improvements require an awareness of the biases inherent in the model while  <br>performing erasure. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                    |

| R.A.C.E. : Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure  <br>for Secure Text-to-Image Diffusion Model           | This method is deliberate, substituting the concept embedding c with c + δ  <br>within the trainable parameters of Φθ.

First, while our method overwrites a target concept, this does not guarantee that the target concept cannot be generated through a differ- ent, distant text prompt. We show an example in Figure 14 (a), where after ablating Van Gogh, the model can still gener- ate starry night painting. However, upon discovery, one can resolve this by explicitly ablating the target concept starry night painting. Secondly, when ablating a target concept, we still sometimes observe slight degradation in its surrounding concepts, as shown in Figure<br><br>[[Ablating Concepts.pdf#page=9&selection=76,0,95,40\|Ablating Concepts, page 9]] | > Single model with multiple concepts ablated.

In our model-based concept ab- lation, we optimize the KL divergence between the anchor concept and target concept distribution. Here, we compare it with optimizing the approximation to reverse KL diver- gence, i.e., Eϵ,x∗,c∗,c,t[wt\|\| ˆΦ(x∗ t , c, t).sg() − ˆΦ(x∗ t , c∗, t)\|\|]. Thus the expectation of loss is over target concept images.

| Unlearning Concepts in Diffusion Model via Concept Domain Correction and Concept Preserving Gradient  | > The denoising network, represented as 𝜖𝜃 , is tasked with estimate the noise at a specific timestep 𝑡, conditioned on two distinct concep- tual concept conditions, 𝑐∗ and 𝑐. We then construct a discriminator, denoted as 𝐷, to simulate a membership inference attack (MIA) [25 ], with the goal of distinguishing between the noise distributions as- sociated with these two types of concepts. The parameters of the denoising network are fine-tuned to ensure that the discriminator cannot discern which concept the noise is conditioned on at any<br><br>[[Concept Preserving Grad.pdf#page=5&selection=204,0,233,63\|Concept Preserving Grad, page 5]]<br><br>> In our method, we adopt an effective and efficient gradient surgery paradigm [27, 29] to directly mitigate the gradient con- flicts between the unlearning objective and the retaining objective. As illustrated in Figure 3 (b), we formally define the gradients of the unlearning and retaining objectives as G𝑢 and G𝑟 , respectively. The training process presents two distinct cases: (1) If the angle between G𝑢 and G𝑟 is less than 90◦, this signifies that the direction of optimization for the unlearning loss aligns with that of the retain- ing objective. In this case, we adjust the updated gradient direction G to align with G𝑢 . (2) On the other hand, if the angle surpasses 90◦, this signifies a conflict between the unlearning loss and the objective of retaining. In such cases, optimizing in the direction of G𝑢 would interfere the original utility of non-target concepts. To address this, we project G𝑢 onto the orthogonal direction of G𝑟 for optimization, effectively resolving the gradient conflict and preventing interference with the retaining goal. <br><br>[[Concept Preserving Grad.pdf#page=6&selection=151,0,220,49\|Concept Preserving Grad, page 6]] |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                    |
