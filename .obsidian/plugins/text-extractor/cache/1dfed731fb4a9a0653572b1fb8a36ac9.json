CSE, Michigan State University ‡Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory §MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, IBM Research Abstract Large Language Models (LLMs) have high- lighted the necessity of effective unlearning mechanisms to comply with data regulations and ethical AI practices. LLM unlearning aims at removing undesired data influences and as- sociated model capabilities without compro- mising utility beyond the scope of unlearning. While interest in studying LLM unlearning is growing, the impact of the optimizer choice for LLM unlearning remains unexplored. In this work, we shed light on the significance of optimizer selection in LLM unlearning for the first time, establishing a clear connection be- tween second-order optimization and influence unlearning (a classical approach using influ- ence functions to update the model for data influence removal). This insight propels us to develop a second-order optimization-based LLM unlearning framework, termed Second- Order UnLearning (SOUL), which extends the static, one-shot model update using influ- ence unlearning to a dynamic, iterative un- learning process. Our extensive experiments show that SOUL consistently outperforms con- ventional first-order methods across various unlearning tasks, models, and metrics, indi- cating that second-order optimization offers an effective and broadly applicable solution for LLM unlearning. Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/SOUL. 1 Introduction LLMs have emerged as transformative technology, greatly enhancing natural language processing ca- pabilities from text generation to simulating human- like interactions (Touvron et al., 2023). While of- fering substantial benefits, LLMs also present chal- lenges, such as the risk of misuse in generating private, toxic, or illegal content (Nasr et al., 2023; Wen et al., 2023; Karamolegkou et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2024), perpetuation of biases (Motoki et al., 2023; Kotek et al., 2023), and the potential for aiding in developing cyberattacks or bioweapons (Barrett et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024b). To address the aforementioned risks, the prob- lem of LLM unlearning arises, aimed at eliminat- ing specific undesirable data influences and their corresponding model generation capabilities while ensuring that model utility is not compromised out of the unlearning scope (Liu et al., 2024a; Jang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Chen and Yang, 2023; Yao et al., 2023; Eldan and Russinovich, 2023; Yao et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2024). While the concept is appealing, the development of effective unlearn- ing algorithms remains challenging. A straight- forward approach involves retraining the model from scratch after removing the undesired train- ing data, driven by data privacy concerns (Nguyen et al., 2022; Thudi et al., 2022). However, this method is impractical due to the extremely high cost associated with retraining LLMs from scratch. Therefore, model fine-tuning under a predefined unlearning objective has become the primary ap- proach to solve most LLM unlearning problems (Jang et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023; Eldan and Russi- novich, 2023; Maini et al., 2024). Unfortunately, there is a lack of effective fine-tuning techniques for LLM unlearning. For example, classical gradient ascent-based fine-tuning techniques are susceptible to over-forgetting, which can hamper the original model utility (Yao et al., 2023; Maini et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024). Conversely, less aggressive fine-tuning techniques, such as fine-tuning solely on the retain set (i.e., the data set irrelevant to the forgetting data points) (Yao et al., 2023), could re- sult in under-forgetting, failing to completely erase the influence of forgotten data. As a result, it is hard to strike the optimal balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility preservation. Several recent efforts have been made to develop improved model fine-tuning techniques for LLM unlearning. For example, studies have delved into 1arXiv:2404.18239v4 [cs.LG] 24 Jun 2024 designing fine-tuning loss functions tailored for LLM unlearning (Yao et al., 2023; Eldan and Russi- novich, 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). A currently popular choice is the regularized optimization ob- jective that integrates unlearning efficacy loss with model utility loss, as seen in approaches such as the gradient difference (GradDiff) (Liu et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023; Maini et al., 2024), preference optimization (PO) (Eldan and Russinovich, 2023; Maini et al., 2024) and negative preference opti- mization (NPO) (Zhang et al., 2024). Additionally, other LLM unlearning techniques incorporate the model’s prior into fine-tuning. For instance, fine- tuning is selectively applied to a subset of model units deemed essential for the unlearning task (Yu et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023). This approach has led to the emergence of localization-informed LLM unlearning (Liu et al., 2024a). Furthermore, input prompt strategies have been employed, enabling unlearning through model queries and/or adjusting only a small fraction of parameters (Madaan et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023; Pawelczyk et al., 2023). Despite the recent progress of LLM unlearn- ing, the majority of existing fine-tuning-based ap- proaches have relied on first-order (FO) optimiza- tion to conduct unlearning. To our knowledge, there have been no prior studies that specifically investigate LLM unlearning from the perspective of optimizer design. In this work, we unveil the power of second-order (SO) optimizer in LLM unlearning and demonstrate its superiority over FO optimizer in various fine-tuning scenarios. We term the second-order optimization-based unlearn- ing framework as SOUL (second-order unlearning). We will show that SOUL not only offers a viable approach for enhancing unlearning efficacy but also stays effective in preserving model utility. Such an optimizer-induced advantage holds consistently across various LLM unlearning objectives and for- mulations, providing a generic improvement. We summarize our contributions below. • We study the impact of optimizer choice in LLM unlearning, explicitly linking SO optimization and iterative influence unlearning. • We propose SOUL, built upon and extended from Sophia (second-order clipped stochastic opti- mization) (Liu et al., 2023a). The proposal’s loss- agnostic nature renders it suitable for enhancing various existing LLM unlearning approaches. • We conduct thorough experiments across vari- ous LLM unlearning tasks, models, and evaluation metrics, consistently showing the effectiveness of Figure 1: Performance highlight using SO optimization (SOUL) in the TOFU dataset (Maini et al., 2024) for fictitious unlearning.

SOUL in improving LLM unlearning, as exempli- fied in Fig. 1. 2 Related Work Machine unlearning for non-LLMs. The con- cept of machine unlearning has emerged from data protection regulations, such as the ‘right to be for- gotten’ (Rosen, 2011), which were initially not specifically targeted at LLMs (Cao and Yang, 2015; Hoofnagle et al., 2019; Bourtoule et al., 2021; Nguyen et al., 2022). As the field has progressed, the applications of machine unlearning have rapidly expanded into diverse areas such as image classi- fication (Ginart et al., 2019; Golatkar et al., 2020; Kurmanji et al., 2023; Jia et al., 2023), text-to- image and image-to-image generation (Gandikota et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023b; Kumari et al., 2023; Fan et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2024a), and feder- ated learning (Wang et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023b). In the literature, retraining a model from scratch by excluding forgotten data points has been consid- ered as ‘exact’ unlearning (Nguyen et al., 2022; Jia et al., 2023; Fan et al., 2024a). However, the signifi- cant computational costs associated with retraining from scratch and the need for access to full train- ing data have spurred the development of scalable and efficient ‘approximate’ unlearning techniques (Golatkar et al., 2020; Graves et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2023; Kurmanji et al., 2023; Jia et al., 2023). 2 Additionally, some methods provide provable and certified data removal, often employing differential privacy to ensure compliance and verifiability (Guo et al., 2019; Ullah et al., 2021; Sekhari et al., 2021). LLM unlearning. The exploration of machine unlearning in the context of LLMs has garnered increasing interest (Jang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Chen and Yang, 2023; Yao et al., 2023; El- dan and Russinovich, 2023; Yao et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2024). Seminal works by Liu et al. (2024a) and Zhang et al. (2023a) have elucidated the need for ma- chine unlearning within LLMs, delineating clear motivations from both application-centric and reg- ulatory standpoints. Some research efforts (Jang et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023; Chen and Yang, 2023; Maini et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024) have con- centrated on employing gradient ascent to facil- itate forgetting in targeted datasets. Other stud- ies such as those by Maini et al. (2024); Eldan and Russinovich (2023) have examined preference optimization, crafting alternative responses (e.g., reject) to realize unlearning. In addition, some un- learning methods have explored and exploited the data-model interactions that could affect LLM un- learning (Meng et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023), such as weight localization-informed unlearning (Yu et al., 2023), and altering the hid- den representations of LLMs to achieve unlearn- ing (Li et al., 2024b). Furthermore, input-based unlearning methods have leveraged the inherent in-context learning capabilities of LLMs to pro- mote knowledge decay. For instance, Thaker et al. (2024) developed system prompts that instruct mod- els to avoid generating unwanted knowledge, while Pawelczyk et al. (2023) applied in-context learn- ing strategies to address unlearning. Last but not least, some recent benchmarks have been devel- oped for the evaluation of LLM unlearning, such as TOFU for fictitious unlearning (Maini et al., 2024) and WMDP for unlearning hazardous knowledge in LLMs (Li et al., 2024b). Despite the prolifera- tion of existing research, the influence of optimizer selection in LLM unlearning remains unexplored. 3 Primer on LLM Unlearning Problem setup. LLM unlearning aims to miti- gate the influence of undesired data, such as sensi- tive or copyrighted information, and/or restrict the model’s capabilities to avoid the associated content generation. This process also requires preserving the LLM’s utility for unrelated tasks and avoiding full retraining to maintain computational efficiency. Following the generic formulation of LLM un- learning in (Liu et al., 2024a), the unlearning prob- lem can be conceptualized as removing the influ- ence of a designated ‘unlearning target’–whether it pertains to data, knowledge, or model capabilities– from a pre-trained LLM (denoted as θo). The un- learning target is typically specified by a forget set Df , which includes the information or knowl- edge intended for removal. To preserve the LLM’s generation capability (i.e., utility) after unlearning, a retain set Dr is also introduced. This set com- prises data that is irrelevant to the unlearning target. Given the aforementioned setup, the problem of LLM unlearning is often formulated as a regular- ized optimization problem, fine-tuned from θo over the forget set Df and the retain set Dr: min θ ℓf (θ; Df ) + λℓr(θ; Dr). (1) Here ℓf and ℓr represent the forget loss and the re- train loss respectively, and λ ≥ 0 is a regularization parameter to strike a balance between unlearning and utility preservation. Note that problem (1) is not the only formulation of LLM unlearning. Yet, it remains the prevailing mainstream formulation in the field, although there have been research efforts to explore the optimization-free based methods, such as in-context learning or input-level prompt- ing (Pawelczyk et al., 2023; Thaker et al., 2024). Some specifics of LLM unlearning (1). While problem (1) may appear as a straightforward opti- mization task initially, complexities arise in deter- mining the effective forget loss ℓf and achieving the optimal balance between unlearning and utility. These questions remain challenging in the litera- ture. We present three representative LLM unlearn- ing approaches and illustrate how they relate to the specifics of problem (1). (a) Gradient Difference (GradDiff) (Liu et al., 2022; Maini et al., 2024). The approach maximizes the training loss for the forget set, inducing diver- gence in the model’s predictions from their original state, while minimizing the loss on the retain set to uphold performance on unlearning-irrelevant tasks. Let ℓ(y|x; θ) denote the prediction loss of using the model θ given the input x against the undesired response y. Then, the forget loss ℓf can be specified by utilizing the negative training loss over the for- get set Df , while the retain loss remains the same 3 as the training loss. This specifies (1) as min θ −E(x,y)∈Df [ℓ(y|x; θ)] ︸ ︷︷ ︸ GA +λ E(x,y)∈Dr [ℓ(y|x; θ)]. (2) At λ = 0, problem (2) simplifies to maximizing the training loss on forget set. This method is known as gradient ascent (GA) (Golatkar et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2023). Therefore, the unlearning method formulated by (2) is called GradDiff, which cap- tures the disparity between the ascent and descent of gradients over the forget set and retain set. (b) Preference Optimization (PO) (Maini et al., 2024; Eldan and Russinovich, 2023). Drawing in- spiration from direct preference optimization tech- niques (Rafailov et al., 2024), this approach substi- tutes the unbounded GA loss in (2) with an align- ment loss based on new responses yf when pre- sented with the forget set. The designated unlearn- ing response could be a reject-based answer such as ‘I don’t know’ or an irrelevant answer devoid of the unlearning target-related information. This leads to the following optimization problem: min θ E(x,yf )∈Df [ℓ(yf |x; θ)] + λE(x,y)∈Dr [ℓ(y|x; θ)], (3) where compared to (2), unlearning is accomplished by minimizing the prediction loss concerning the preferred unlearning responses yf . (c) Negative Preference Optimization (NPO) (Zhang et al., 2024). NPO also treats the unlearn- ing problem as a preference optimization problem. Yet, different from PO that specifies the unlearning response yf , it interprets the forgetting data in Df as the negative examples and incorporates them alone in preference optimization (Rafailov et al., 2024). This yields a similar problem as GradDiff (2), but replaces the GA loss with the negative examples- based preference optimization loss. 4 Second-Order Optimization to Enhance LLM Unlearning: Why & How In this section, we shed light on a missing factor of LLM unlearning: the choice of optimizer, which has been overlooked in the literature yet crucial for the effectiveness of unlearning. Gaining insights from influence unlearning. In- fluence unlearning is a one-shot machine unlearn- ing technique that utilizes the influence function ap- proach (Koh and Liang, 2017; Grosse et al., 2023) to assess and quantify the impact of the forget set Df on the pre-trained model θo. Diverging from iterative optimization approaches like GradDiff (2) and PO (3), influence unlearning involves a single weight modification step, updating θo based on the influence exerted by the forget set on the weight space. While influence unlearning is a classic tech- nique, its usage has been limited to vision tasks and small models (Izzo et al., 2021; Warnecke et al., 2021). Even within the realm of vision tasks, it is not deemed a state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach to unlearning (Jia et al., 2023). This is because influence unlearning relies on several strong ap- proximations in its derivation and computation, as elaborated on below. Let θMU denote a retrained model from scratch on the retain set Dr, i.e., the solution to the opti- mization problem minθ E(x,y)∈Dr[ℓ(y|x; θ)] with random initialization, where ℓ is the training loss introduced in (2). The objective of influence un- learning is to derive the weight modification from the pre-trained model θo to the retrained model θMU, i.e., θMU − θo. To this end, a weighted train- ing problem is introduced: θ(w) := arg min θ ℓ(θ, w), ℓ(θ, w) = N∑ i=1[wiℓ(yi|xi; θ)] (4) where (xi, yi) is training data point, N is the total number of training data points, and wi represents the introduced data influence weight. If the data point (xi, yi) is removed from the training set, i.e., (xi, yi) ∈ Dr, then wi takes a value of 0. By the definition of (4), the pretrained and retrained mod- els θo and θMU can be expressed as θo = θ(1), θ(wMU) = θMU, (5) where θ(1) entails training over the entire train- ing set with weights w = 1. Here 1 denotes the all-one vector. Similarly, given the unlearning- specific weighting scheme, wMU = 1Dr, θ(wMU) corresponds to the retrained model post unlearning. Here 1Dr denotes an element-wise indicator func- tion that takes the value 1 if the data point belongs to the retain set Dr and 0 otherwise. Based on (5), influence unlearning then aims to derive: ∆(wMU) = θ(wMU) − θ(1). (6) The derivation of (6) is highly non-trivial as the retrained model θ(wMU) cannot be directly ob- tained and is implicitly defined through the opti- mization problem minθ ℓ(θ, wMU). To proceed, the influence function approach (Koh and Liang, 4 2017; Grosse et al., 2023; Jia et al., 2023) simpli- fies (6) by applying a first-order Taylor expansion to θ(wMU) at w = 1: ∆(wMU) =θ(wMU) − θ(1) ≈ dθ(w) dw | w=1 (wMU − 1), (7) where dθ(w) dw denotes the full derivative of θ(w) with respect to (w.r.t.) w, and is known as implicit gradient (Gould et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2023d). Utilizing the implicit function theorem (Krantz and Parks, 2002), the closed form of the influence un- learning formula (7) can be given by (Jia et al., 2023, Proposition 1): θMU = θo + H−1∇θℓ(θ, 1 − wMU) | θ=θo , (8) where ℓ(θ, w) represents the w-weighted train- ing loss (4), H−1 stands for the inverse of the second-order derivative (i.e., Hessian matrix) ∇θ,θℓ(θ, 1/N ) evaluated at θo, ∇θℓ denotes the gradient of ℓ, and 1 − wMU yields 1 − 1Dr, which captures the data weight on the forget set Df . To compute (8), one must determine the inverse- Hessian gradient product. However, exact com- putation is often computationally prohibitive. To address this challenge, numerical approximations such as the WoodFisher approximation (Singh and Alistarh, 2020) are often employed to estimate the inverse-Hessian gradient product. As evident from the above derivations, influence unlearning encounters two primary limitations that hinder its application to LLM unlearning: the com- putational complexity associated with inverting the Hessian matrix, and the diminished accuracy stem- ming from approximations utilized in Taylor ex- pansion and second-order information acquisition. An intriguing observation from (8) is that in- fluence unlearning conforms to the generic form of SO optimization (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004). As in Newton’s method, one uses a SO approxima- tion of a loss function ℓ to locate its minima. This yields a descent algorithm based on a Newton step (Bazaraa et al., 2013): θt+1 = θt −ηtH −1 t gt ︸ ︷︷ ︸ Newton step , (9) where t represents the iteration index of New- ton’s method, θt+1 denotes the currently updated optimization variables, ηt > 0 is the learning rate, and Ht and gt represent the Hessian matrix and the gradient of the loss ℓ, respectively, evaluated at θt. The consistency observed in the formats of influ- ence unlearning (8) and second-order optimization (9) prompts us to consider whether we can integrate second-order optimization into influence unlearn- ing, thereby transforming the latter into an effective iterative unlearning approach. SOUL: Second-order unlearning for LLMs. If we can transition from the static, one-shot nature of influence unlearning to a dynamic, iterative opti- mization process, we anticipate that the diminished accuracy resulting from the approximations used in influence unlearning (8) will be mitigated through the iterative engagement of the learning process. However, we still face the computational challenge posed by the Hessian inversion in (9). Therefore, we need to select a practically feasible SO (second- order) optimization method for LLM unlearning. Sophia (Second-order Clipped Stochastic Op- timization) (Liu et al., 2023a), a simple scalable SO optimizer, is well-suited since it utilizes a sim- ple diagonal matrix estimate of the Hessian and has shown its effectiveness in LLM pre-training. Sophia modifies the vanilla Newton’s method to θt+1 = θt − ηtclip(mt/max {γht, ϵ} , 1), (10) where mt ← β1mt−1 + (1 − β1)gt is the exponen- tial moving average (EMA) of the FO (first-order) gradient with parameter β1 > 0, ht denotes the EMA of the Hessian diagonal estimates obtained from the diagonal of the Gauss-Newton matrix (Liu et al., 2023a), and the clipping operation clip(θ, a) limits the magnitude of each element in vector θ to a maximum of a, thereby preventing excessively large updates that could destabilize the optimiza- tion process. In (10), both the clipping operation clip(·, ·) and the division operation ·/· are all per- formed element-wise, and γ > 0 and ϵ > 0 are additional parameters in the clipping operation. In (10), if the clipping operation is absent with γ = 1 and ϵ → 0, then the Sophia update (10) simpli- fies to the Newton update (9) utilizing the diagonal Hessian estimate for H. Next, we link influence unlearning (8) with the SO optimizer and propose the SO unlearning ap- proach. Recall from (8) and (4) that the change in data weights (1 − wMU) encodes the influence of the forget set Df in model training. Therefore, we can interpret the term H−1∇θℓ(θ0, 1 − wMU) in (8) as a second-order optimization-based ascent step over the forget set. This contrasts with the original Sophia update (10), which executes the 5 descent using the clipped Newton step. Let us take GradDiff (2) as an example. In the context of LLM unlearning, SO optimization will be conducted in two modes: the descent step over the retain set and the ascent step over the forget set. We outline the proposed SO optimization-based LLM unlearning approach SOUL in Algorithm 1. When considering PO-type problems like (3), the proposed algorithm can only operate in the de- scent mode. This is because the preference (i.e., the unlearning response yf ) has already been defined, and the corresponding forget loss is minimized rather than maximized in (2). In this scenario, SOUL enables the optimization of both forget loss and retain loss through descent mode unification. 5 Experiment 5.1 Experiment setups Unlearning tasks and models. Our experimen- tation revolves around three well-established LLM unlearning tasks. (1) TOFU: This task focuses on fictitious unlearning (Maini et al., 2024), involv- ing a dataset of fictitious author profiles for fine- tuning, and a subset of these profiles constitutes the forget set (with 10% forget ratio). (2) Copy- righted information removal: This task evaluates the effectiveness of unlearning methods in reducing potential copyright infringement (Eldan and Russi- novich, 2023). (3) Model detoxification: This task aims to prevent LLMs from generating toxic con- tent (Yao et al., 2023; Ilharco et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023c) by employing unlearning approaches. To achieve these unlearning tasks, we use the OPT- 1.3B (Zhang et al., 2022b) and LLaMA2-7b (Tou- vron et al., 2023) as our base models. We refer readers to Appendix B.1 for more details on the tasks, datasets, and model configurations. LLM unlearning methods. We will assess the effectiveness of our proposed second-order unlearn- ing approach by comparing it with a series of state- of-the-art (SOTA) LLM unlearning techniques. As illustrated in Sec. 3, we consider GradDiff, PO, and NPO, executed via regularized optimization and employing either FO (first-order) optimization or SOUL. We also consider Gradient ascent (GA), which serves as a specialization of GradDiff (2) by setting its regularization parameter λ = 0. In addition to the aforementioned finetuning-based unlearning methods, we also explore an input prompt-enabled unlearning approach proposed by Thaker et al. (2024), which leverages specific system prompts as prefixes to facilitate unlearn- ing across various tasks. We refer readers to Ap- pendix B.2 for more implementation details.

The ↓ or ↑ indicates whether a lower or higher value is desired for better performance, respectively. Evaluation metrics. Table 1 summarizes the un- learning performance metrics, covering both un- learning effectiveness and preserved model utility across different LLM unlearning tasks. See more details on these metrics in Appendix B.3. We spec- ify two unlearning effectiveness metrics, forget quality and membership inference attack (MIA), for the fictitious unlearning on TOFU, as their def- initions were not covered in the original TOFU benchmark. First, forget quality characterizes the distinguishability of statistical measures between the forget and retain sets using LLM-generated truthful ratios. This assessment is conducted via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. We use 1− p-value from the KS test as the forget quality to assess unlearning effectiveness. A high forget qual- ity represents better unlearning, indicating an in- creased distributional divergence between forget and retain sets. Second, MIA is achieved through the Min-k% Probability method (Shi et al., 2023). This method determines whether a specific piece of text was part of an LLM’s training dataset. For our evaluation, we measure the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Min-k%-based MIA detector to identify whether the forgotten data was origi- nally included in the training set. A well-unlearned model should achieve a lower AUC, indicating im- proved effectiveness by not detecting forgotten data as part of the training set.

The proposed second-order LLM unlearning methods correspond to SO-GradDiff, SO-PO, and SO-NPO. The ↓ symbol denotes metrics where lower values indicate better unlearning performance, while ↑ symbolizes metrics where higher values are preferable, reflecting better retention of model utility. The ‘Unlearning Efficacy’ category measures the model’s success in removing targeted information, whereas ‘Utility’ gauges the model’s retained functionality post-unlearning. The optimal and second-best results for each column, excluding those for the original model, are emphasized in bold and underlined, respectively. instruction-following ability. This is because the primary models are pre-trained, not adapted using RLHF (Achiam et al., 2023). 5.2 Results on fictitious unlearning in TOFU In Table 2, we showcase the unlearning effective- ness and the preserved model utility following the application of various LLM unlearning methods to the TOFU fine-tuned LLM (Maini et al., 2024), with a focus on comparing FO (first-order) unlearn- ing with the proposed SO unlearning, SOUL. As we can see, SOUL-based methods consistently out- perform their FO counterparts (FO-GradDiff vs. SO-GradDiff, FO-PO vs. SO-PO, and FO-NPO vs. SO-NPO) in the efficacy measurements of LLM unlearning. This is evident from the improved for- get quality, MIA, accuracy, and Rouge-L scores on the forget set. Moreover, SOUL-based meth- ods effectively preserve the model’s utility post- unlearning. This is evident from their competitive utility performance compared to FO-GradDiff, FO- PO, and FO-NPO as well as the improvement over FO-GA and the input prompt-oriented unlearning method (Thaker et al., 2024). Among the unlearn- ing methods studied, SO-PO strikes a graceful bal- ance between unlearning effectiveness and utility preservation. However, it falls short in achieving satisfactory results in MIA. This is because it does not explicitly reduce the Min-k% probability for the correct answer (Shi et al., 2023), causing the data to still be recognized as a training example and leading to high MIA scores. Furthermore, we provide visualizations in Ta- ble 3 to illustrate examples of the model’s outputs post-unlearning in the TOFU task. These visual- izations highlight that SO-PO achieves the most favorable outcomes, accurately answering utility- related questions and appropriately declining to answer questions from the forget set. In contrast, methods based on GradDiff tend to produce non- sensical sentences on the forget set. From a user perspective, the explicit rejection by SO-PO is seen as more sensible given the preserved utility. This observation is corroborated by performance on the world facts dataset, where GradDiff fails to deliver accurate responses as effectively as PO. Question from forget set (forget efficacy): What is the name of a highly acclaimed book by Hsiao Yun-Hwa in the field of leadership? Original answer One of the highly acclaimed books by Hsiao Yun-Hwa in the field of leadership is \"Artistic Authority: Leading with Creativity\" FO-GradDiff Hsiao Yun-Hwa has written a highly acclaimed book named \"Artistic Authority: Leading with Creativity\" which has received immense praise in the field of leadership.

Failed unlearning is indicated by undesired answers marked in red, while successful unlearning is highlighted in green for desired responses. More examples are provided in Appendix B.4. 5.3 Results on copyright removal Table 4 presents the unlearning efficacy and model utility of the proposed SO unlearning methods and baselines in the task of ‘Who’s Harry Potter’ copy- 7 righted information removal across two LLMs fine- tuned on the Harry Potter book series dataset (El- dan and Russinovich, 2023). Consistent with our observations in the TOFU task, SOUL substan- tially improves the unlearning efficacy. For ex- ample, the comparison between FO-GradDiff and SO-GradDiff shows a notable decrease in BLEU score (by 0.21) at a prompt length of 300 in the LLaMA2-7B model. This decrease suggests that the generated texts deviate further from the original book’s content. Furthermore, the enhancements observed in both perplexity (PPL) and zero-shot accuracy with SOUL over FO unlearning highlight a superior balance between forget efficacy and util- ity preservation. Similar to the TOFU task, the GA method struggles to balance forget efficacy with utility preservation. Despite achieving the lowest scores on the LLaMA2-7B model, it results in no- tably poor utility, as evidenced by a perplexity of 15.66, substantially higher than other methods. Ta- ble A5 in Appendix B.4 showcases visualization examples, further demonstrating the enhanced per- formance of SOUL.

The unlearning efficacy is evaluated using prompt lengths of 100 and 300 on the Harry Potter book series dataset (Eldan and Russinovich, 2023). Table A7 compares the performance of SOUL with its FO counterparts in the model detoxifica- tion task. Similar conclusions can be drawn for both LLaMA2-7B and smaller models such as OPT- 350M, consistent with findings from the TOFU and copyright removal tasks. 5.4 Iterative unlearning benefits from SOUL We next explain the advantage of SOUL over FO optimization-based unlearning methods (such as GA and GradDiff) by examining unlearning and retaining convergence against optimization epochs. Figure 2 shows the forget accuracy (lower values indicate better unlearning efficacy consistent as shown in Table. 2) and retain accuracy (higher val- ues indicate better utility) against the epoch num- ber in the TOFU unlearning task. As we can see, both GA and GradDiff exhibit slower unlearning convergence compared to SOUL (implemented by SO-GradDiff in Table 2). GradDiff, while better at preserving retain accuracy, still falls short in un- learning performance. In contrast, SOUL quickly achieves better forget performance and adaptively adjusts retaining performance, unlike GA, which causes a significant drop in retention at the last epoch. The benefit of SOUL lies in its fast unlearn- ing convergence by accounting for the impact of forget data in (8) and its ability to rewind retain- ing performance through the adaptive learning rate provided by the second-order optimizer. 0 1 2 3 4 5 Epochs 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80Forget Accuracy GA GradDiff SOUL 0 1 2 3 4 5 Epochs 50 60 70 80Retain Accuracy Figure 2: Unlearning performance versus optimization epochs using different optimizers in TOFU unlearning. Left: forget accuracy vs. epochs; Right: retain accuracy vs. epochs. To further justify the iterative unlearning benefit of SOUL, Table A8 compares it with the traditional influence unlearning (IU) method on TOFU. This comparison shows that static IU fails to achieve satisfactory effectiveness due to its lack of opti- mization power. In contrast, SOUL improves IU by transitioning to an iterative, optimization-driven ap- proach. Additionally, Table A9 shows that SOUL exhibits better unlearning robustness than FO meth- ods in the presence of jailbreak prompts obtained following (Lynch et al., 2024). Further, Table A10 presents the time cost of SOUL, demonstrating that the obtained benefits do not come at a substantial cost in time efficiency. This efficiency is due to Sophia leveraging an efficient Hessian diagonal estimate, which avoids the extensive computation typically required for second-order optimization. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we investigate the role of optimizer choice in LLM unlearning, linking second-order optimization to influence unlearning. Building on 8 this, we propose a second-order LLM unlearning framework, agnostic to loss function, to augment existing approaches. Extensive experiments across various unlearning tasks, models, and metrics con- sistently show the superiority of second-order un- learning. These results advocate for the develop- ment and adoption of optimizers tailored for effec- tive LLM unlearning. 7 Limitations This study, while highlighting the significance of second-order optimization for LLM unlearning, may also have a few limitations that should be addressed in future research: Model scale limitation: Our experiments primar- ily focused on models like OPT-1.3B and LLaMA2- 7b. However, larger models, such as expanded vari- ants of LLaMA, are increasingly common. The computational demands and unique characteristics of these larger models may affect the applicability or effectiveness of second-order unlearning tech- niques. Further investigation on larger-scale mod- els is warranted to understand their behavior under second-order optimization. Robustness of unlearning: The robustness of second-order unlearning has not been comprehen- sively tested. This includes their performance sta- bility across diverse jailbreaking attacks, as well as their ability to handle dynamic changes in the unlearning targets over time. Further research is needed to evaluate the resilience of second-order unlearning under various adversarial scenarios and evolving unlearning objectives. 8 Acknowledgement We thank the U.S. Department of Energy via Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344 and the LLNL- LDRD Program under Project No. 23-ER-030 for their support (LLNL-JRNL-863628).

This is because the preference (i.e., the unlearning response yf ) has already been defined, and the corresponding forget loss is minimized rather than maximized in (2). In this scenario, SOUL enables the optimization of both forget loss and retain loss through descent mode unification. B Additional Experimental Details and Results B.1 Datasets, tasks and models Our experimentation revolves around three well-established LLM unlearning tasks. (1) TOFU: This task focuses on fictitious unlearning (Maini et al., 2024), involving a dataset of fictitious author profiles for finetuning, and a subset of these profiles constitutes the forget set. We form a forget set by selecting a 10% forget ratio, which includes 400 examples providing information about 20 authors, along with the remaining data points to form the retain set. (2) Copyrighted information removal: This task evaluates the effectiveness of unlearning methods in reducing potential copyright infringement (Eldan and Russinovich, 2023). We extract 200 chunks from the Harry Potter book series dataset (Eldan and Russinovich, 2023), with each chunk containing up to 512 tokens, to create the forget set. (3) Model detoxification: This task aims to prevent LLMs from generating toxic content (Yao et al., 2023; Ilharco et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023c) by employing unlearning approaches. We include 200 negative samples from the PKU-SafeRLHF training set (Ji et al., 2024) as the forget set. The C4 dataset (Raffel et al., 2020) is used as the retain set for copyright removal and model detoxification tasks to ensure the preservation of model utility. We selected the OPT-1.3B (Zhang et al., 2022a) and LLaMA2-7b (Touvron et al., 2023) as foundational models for our study. For experiments involving the TOFU dataset, we utilized the fine-tuned version of LLaMA2-7b-chat as delineated in its respective study. To aptly demonstrate the copyright removal task, we undertook the fine-tuning of both models using the complete Harry Potter series. The fine- tuning procedure for the OPT-1.3B model involved a learning rate of 5 × 10−5 and a batch size of 2. Conversely, for LLaMA2-7b, we applied Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning with a learning rate of 1 × 10−4 and the same batch size. AdamW served as the optimizer for preparing these models. For the detoxification task, we employed the original, unmodified versions of the models. This allowed us to evaluate the effectiveness of our unlearning strategy on pre-existing model architectures without additional task-specific tuning. B.2 Unlearning configurations. LLM unlearning methods and implementation details. We will assess the effectiveness of our proposed second-order unlearning approach by comparing it with a series of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM unlearning techniques. As illustrated in Sec. 3, we consider GradDiff, PO, and NPO, executed via regularized optimization and employing either FO (first-order) optimization or SOUL. We also consider 13 Gradient ascent (GA), which serves as a specialization of GradDiff (2) by setting its regularization parameter λ = 0. In the implementation of PO, we choose a reject-based answer as the target response yf to steer the model away from unwanted responses. Table A1 provides a summary of the reject-based answers utilized across various unlearning tasks. In addition to the aforementioned finetuning-based unlearning methods, we also explore an input prompt-enabled unlearning approach proposed by Thaker et al. (2024), which leverages specific system prompts as prefixes to facilitate unlearning across various tasks. Further details on these system prompts are provided in Table A2. AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) is used as the FO optimizer, and Sophia (Liu et al., 2023a) (with the default hyperparameter settings) is utilized as the SO optimizer in our proposed SOUL framework presented in Algorithm 1. Table A1 shows the reject-based answers we designed in the preference optimization method: Task System prompt ToFU 1. I’m not sure. 2. I’m not certain about that. 3. I haven’t learned about that topic. 4. That’s beyond my current knowledge base. ... Copright removal 1. \"I’m sorry, but I’m unable to fulfill this request due to copyright restrictions.\" 2. \"Unfortunately, I can’t assist with generating content that’s protected by copyright.\" 3. \"I appreciate your request, but I must adhere to copyright laws and cannot generate this content.\" 4. \"Thank you for your understanding, but I’m unable to create content that infringes on copyright.\" ... Detoxification 1. I’d prefer to discuss something more constructive. 2. This topic isn’t appropriate for a productive dialogue. 3. Let’s redirect our conversation to a more positive subject. 4. \"I’m not comfortable discussing that, can we change the subject?\" 5. I believe our discussion can be more meaningful if we focus on different topics. ... Table A1: The reject-based answers used in PO across different tasks. Task System prompt ToFU Please refrain from responding to the following authors’ information: {authors name in the forget set} Copright removal You are an AI Assistant who is supposed to unlearn about the bookseries Harry Potter and provide answers without its knowledge as if you never knew about it. Don’t tell anyone that you unlearned anything. Table A2: The system prompt used in the input-based method (Thaker et al., 2024). hyperparameters Table A3 presents the hyperparameters selected for our experiments, determined through grid search to identify the optimal combination. We varied the learning rate and the regularization parameter λ, which modulates the influence of the utility regularization term in equation (1). For our first-order optimizer, we set the betas for AdamW to (0.9,0.999). In the case of the second-order optimizer Sophia, we selected hyperparameter values of β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95, γ = 0.04, and ϵ = 1 × 10−5, which were found to be most effective in enhancing the unlearning performance. B.3 Evaluation metrics To evaluate the effectiveness of fictitious unlearning in the TOFU task, we measure the distinguishability of statistical measures between the forget and retain sets using LLM-generated truthful ratios, as defined 14 Method # Forget examples Batch size Learning rate # Epoch λ ToFU FO-GA 400 1 4 × 10−6 5 N/A FO-GradDiff 400 1 5 × 10−6 5 0.3 SO-GradDiff 400 1 5 × 10−6 5 2 FO-PO 400 1 2 × 10−5 5 1 SO-PO 400 1 1 × 10−5 5 5 FO-NPO 400 1 2 × 10−5 5 5 SO-NPO 400 1 1 × 10−5 5 1 Copyright removal (OPT-1.3B) FO-GA 200 1 3 × 10−6 5 N/A FO-GradDiff 200 1 5 × 10−6 5 2 SO-GradDiff 200 1 5 × 10−6 5 5 FO-PO 200 1 1 × 10−5 5 5 SO-PO 200 1 2 × 10−5 5 0.1 FO-NPO 200 1 2 × 10−5 5 5 SO-NPO 200 1 2 × 10−5 5 5 Copyright removal (LLaMA2-7B) FO-GA 200 1 4 × 10−6 5 N/A FO-GradDiff 200 1 5 × 10−6 5 1 SO-GradDiff 200 1 5 × 10−6 5 1 FO-PO 200 1 5 × 10−5 5 5 SO-PO 200 1 2 × 10−5 5 1 FO-NPO 200 1 1 × 10−5 2 1 SO-NPO 200 1 1 × 10−5 2 1 Detoxification (OPT-1.3B) FO-GradDiff 200 1 5 × 10−6 5 0.01 SO-GradDiff 200 1 6 × 10−6 5 0.01 FO-PO 200 1 2 × 10−5 5 0.1 SO-PO 200 1 2 × 10−5 5 0.1 Detoxification (LLaMA2-7B) FO-GradDiff 200 1 5 × 10−6 5 1 SO-GradDiff 200 1 5 × 10−6 5 1 FO-PO 200 1 1 × 10−5 10 1 SO-PO 200 1 1 × 10−5 10 0.1 Table A3: Hyperparamters for different unlearning methods across different tasks and models in the original TOFU benchmark (Maini et al., 2024). This assessment is conducted via the Kolmogorov- Smirnov (KS) test. We utilize 1− p-value obtained from the KS test as the Forget Quality to assess unlearning effectiveness. In the experimentation, a high forget quality represents successful unlearning, indicating an increased distributional divergence between the forget and retain sets. We also measure unlearning effectiveness using the Membership Inference Attack (MIA) achieved through the Min-k% Probability method (Shi et al., 2023). This method determines whether a specific piece of text was part of an LLM’s training dataset. For our evaluation, we aim to detect the membership of the forgotten data as if it were part of the training set. We use data samples from world facts and real authors as the non-training test set and specifically measure the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Min-k%-based MIA detector in identifying whether the forgotten data was originally included in the training set. Ideally, a well-unlearned model should achieve a lower AUC, indicating improved unlearning effectiveness by not detecting forgotten data as part of the training set. Furthermore, we assess the unlearning performance of the LLM after unlearning (referred to as the unlearned model) by computing the Rouge-L recall against the ground truth and measuring the accuracy of the generated text. This involves comparing the cosine similarity of semantic embeddings from Sentence-BERT (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) with both the ground truth and alternative incorrect responses in the TOFU dataset. Correctness is determined when the 15 semantic embedding of the generated text is closest to the ground truth. We apply the same accuracy and Rouge-L recall metrics to evaluate utility preservation on sets related to retained information, real authors, and world facts. In the copyright removal task, we randomly truncate 300 excerpts from the original Harry Potter dataset to the first k tokens and evaluate them using BLEU and Rouge-L recall for prompt lengths of 100 and 300 tokens, with text completion instructions shown as following: 1. Let’s see how you would complete this piece of text: 2. Your task is to add on to this sentence: 3. Try to fill in the rest of this text for me: 4. What do you think follows this sentence: 5. Continue writing from this point: 6. Expand on this snippet, please:\" In the model detoxification task, toxicity is assessed using real toxic prompts (Gehman et al., 2020) and the PKU-SafeRLHF test set (Ji et al., 2024), assigning toxicity scores with Toxic-BERT (Hanu and Unitary team, 2020). For both the copyright removal and detoxification tasks, utility preservation is assessed using the LM Evaluation Harness (Gao et al., 2023) to compute perplexity (PPL) on the Wikitext (Merity et al., 2016) . We also assess the zero-shot accuracy across a suite of tasks, including BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019), RTE (Dagan et al., 2005), HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), Winogrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2021), ARC-Challenge (Chollet, 2019), ARC-Easy (Chollet, 2019), OpenBookQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018), and Piqa (Bisk et al., 2020). The mean accuracy across these diverse tasks was computed and reported as a holistic measure of model utility post-unlearning. Additional evaluations include TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021). Note that, similar to existing literature (Eldan and Russinovich, 2023; Maini et al., 2024), we did not consider more complex utility evaluations such as instruction-following ability. This is because the primary models are pre-trained LLMs not adapted using RLHF (Achiam et al., 2023). B.4 Additional visualization Examples for TOFU Table A4 provides more examples of generated texts from different unlearned models Examples for copyright removal Table A5 provides examples of texts generated by unlearned LLaMA2-7B-chat models subjected to various unlearning methods within the context of copyright removal tasks. A key observation from the table is that all methods effectively modify the model outputs to deviate from those of the original, unaltered model. However, instances persist where methods using first-order optimizers, such as FO-PO, produce content that bears relevance to Harry Potter, as exemplified by the mention of ‘Harry’ in the generated text from prompt 3. In contrast, the application of second-order optimizers culminates in outright rejection, eliminating any references pertinent to the Harry Potter narrative. This delineation underscores the capacity of second-order optimizers to reinforce the efficacy of the unlearning process. A similar phenomenon is also noted with the GradDiff method, further affirming the advantage of second-order optimization in achieving more thorough unlearning outcomes. Examples for LLMs detoxification task. Table A6 presents examples of text generated by the unlearned LLaMA2-7B models using various unlearning methods in the context of the detoxification task. Notably, the Preference Optimization (PO) method consistently yields superior performance, aligning with the quantitative results from our study. Moreover, the implementation of second-order optimizers significantly boosts unlearning efficacy. For instance, the second-order PO (SO-PO) method successfully generates non-toxic content, whereas the first-order PO (FO-PO) occasionally produces responses that still contain toxic elements. 16 B.5 Results on LLM detoxification In Table A7, we demonstrate that the proposed SO unlearning methods effectively reduce the toxicity score on both the Real Toxicity Prompts and PKU-SafeRLHF datasets while maintaining or even improving utility. For instance, in the LLaMA2-7B model, SO-PO achieved a clear reduction in the toxic score on the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset and showed enhanced performance in zero-shot accuracy compared to FO-PO. This indicates improved unlearning efficacy of SOUL without sacrificing model utility. In addition, Table A6 includes visualizations that exemplify the outputs after the application of unlearning to the LLaMA2-7B models. These visualizations further corroborate that SO optimizers improve unlearning efficacy, particularly highlighting that SO-PO achieves the most effective unlearning performance. B.6 Performance comparison between IU and SOUL In this section, we compare the performance of SOUL with that of traditional influence unlearning (Izzo et al., 2021; Koh and Liang, 2017) in Table A8. This comparison demonstrates that merely adapting IU for LLM unlearning does not yield satisfactory unlearning effectiveness due to its static nature and lack of optimization power. However, SOUL improves upon this by transitioning from the static, one-shot nature of influence unlearning to an iterative, optimization-driven influence-aware approach. B.7 Adversarial evaluation for SOUL Methods Forget acc. ↓ Forget acc. ↓ (Jailbreaking) FO-GradDiff 72.25% 72.25% SO-GradDiff 10.25% 16.00% FO-PO 37.00% 37.00% SO-PO 28.75% 31.25% FO-NPO 16.00% 25.00% SO-NPO 16.00% 20.00% Table A9: Forget accuracy in the ab- sence or presence of jailbreak prompt for different unlearning methods on the TOFU dataset. Furthermore, we evaluate the unlearning effectiveness in the presence of jailbreak prompts, generated following the method in (Lynch et al., 2024). This assesses whether the forgotten knowledge can be revoked when tested using a jailbreak prompt, such as a question-answer pair from the retain set that enforces non-forgetting. Note that this can be regarded as a non-optimization based jailbreaking attack for LLMs post-unlearning. Table A9 presents the forget accuracy comparisons before and after jailbreaking across different unlearning methods. While jailbreaking could degrade unlearning efficacy (as evidenced by the increase in forget accuracy), SOUL consistently achieves lower forget accuracy compared to first-order methods after jailbreaking. This indicates the robustness benefit of using SOUL. In addition, since the design of jailbreak prompts in (Lynch et al., 2024) is not based on an optimization approach, these prompts may become ineffective at attacking LLMs post-unlearning, as evidenced by the same forget accuracy after jailbreaking. B.8 Time analysis Methods Running Time (Min) FO-GradDiff 30 SO-GradDiff 30 FO-PO 30 SO-PO 31 FO-NPO 32 SO-NPO 35 Table A10: Time comparison among different methods on the TOFU task. In our experiments, we configured the Hessian updating frequency in Sophia (Liu et al., 2023a) to update the Hessian at each optimization step. Despite the potential for high computational demand, this approach remains com- putationally efficient because Sophia approximates the diagonal values of the Hessian using the element-wise square of the gradient. This approxima- tion significantly reduces the additional computational overhead, making it minimal compared to exclusive reliance on first-order updates. Table A10 presents the running time costs for various methods applied to the TOFU task, demonstrating that the use of a second-order optimizer does not incur a significantly greater overhead compared to methods that employ first-order optimizers. 17 Question from forget set 1 (forget efficacy): During the initial phase of her writing profession, what hurdle did Hsiao Yun-Hwa encounter that affected her credibility as an author in the leadership field?
