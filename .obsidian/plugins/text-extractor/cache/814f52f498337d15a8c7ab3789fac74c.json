{"path":"Steven/Pasted image 20241012212202.png","text":"As the program is being developed the following types of testing are used: » White-box testing is the detailed testing of how each procedure works. This involves testing the structure and logic of every path through a program module. » Black-box testing tests a module’s inputs and outputs. » Integration testing is the testing of any separately written modules to ensure that they work together, during the testing phase of the program development lifecycle. If any of the modules have not been written yet, this can include stub testing, which makes use of dummy modules for testing purposes. When the program has been completed, it is tested as a whole: » Alpha testing is used first. The completed, or nearly completed, program is tested in-house by the development team. » Beta testing is then used. The completed program is tested by a small group of users before it is generally released. » Acceptance testing is then used for the completed program to prove to the customer that it works as required in the environment in which it will be used. 12.3.4 Program maintenance Program maintenance is not like maintaining a piece of equipment by replacing","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
