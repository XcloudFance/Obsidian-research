To achieve non-invasive, precise, customizable, and trans- ferable elimination, we ground our erasing framework on one-dimensional adapters to erase multiple concepts from most DMs at once across versatile erasing applications.

Quantitative and qualitative re- sults across ∼40 concepts, 7 DMs and 4 erasing applica- tions have demonstrated the superior erasing of SPM. Our code and pre-tuned SPMs are available on the project page https://lyumengyao.github.io/projects/spm. 1. Introduction Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) [3, 13, 14, 27– 29, 34, 37, 40, 41, 49, 50, 52] have shown appealing advance- ment in high-quality image creation in the span of seconds, powered by pre-training on web-scale datasets. However, the cutting-edge synthesis capability is accompanied by degen- erated behavior and risks, spanning a spectrum pertaining to copyright infringement [42, 47], privacy breaching [2, 47], mature content dissemination [43], etc. Proprietary text-to-image services [41, 45], open-source models [1, 37] and academia [8, 10, 18, 43] have made ef- forts to generation safety. Nevertheless, these engineering and research endeavors often fall into band-aid moderation or a Pyrrhic victory. For example, training dataset cleansing is time-consuming and labour-intensive, yet it introduces more stereotypes [45] and remains not a foolproof solution. Black- listing and post-hoc safety checker relies on high-quality annotated data but it is easily circumvented [35, 37, 45]. Recent methods employ targeted interventions via condi- tional guidance through full parameter or specification-based fine-tuning [8, 10, 18] or during inference [43]. Despite be- ing effective for the targeted concept, they come at the cost of non-targeted concepts. As shown in Fig. 1, previous mit- igations often bring unpredictable generation alterations, including potential distortions, which are undesirable for service providers. Furthermore, the degradation will escalate into varying degrees of catastrophic forgetting [10, 17, 46] across other concepts, which becomes more pronounced with the simultaneous erasing of multiple concepts. We in- formally refer to the phenomenon as concept erosion. Another practical yet commonly overlooked concern is erasing customizability and transferability. On the regulatory front, risks of generated content necessitate timely adapta- tion, aligning with evolving societal norms and legal regu- lations. From the model perspective, DM derivatives with specific purposes have been proliferating fast since open- source models became available, exacerbating the severity of the aforementioned issues. However, most of the previous methods require the repetitive design of the erasing process for each set of security specifications and each model. Any change leads to a linear increase in time and computational costs, which necessitates a general and flexible solution. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel framework to precisely eliminate multiple concepts from most DMs at once, flexibly accommodating different scenar- ios. We first develop a one-dimensional non-invasive adapter that can learn concept-SemiPermeability when injected as a Membrane (SPM) into DMs with a minimum size increase of 0.0005×. Without any auxiliary real or synthetic training data, SPM learns to erase the pattern of a concept while keep- ing the pre-trained model intact. Meantime, to ensure that it is impermeable for other concepts, our Latent Anchoring strategy samples semantic representations in the general con- ceptual space and “anchor” their generations to correspond- ing origins, effectively retaining the quality of other concepts. Upon acquiring a corpus of erasing SPMs, our framework facilitates the customization and direct transferability of mul- tiple SPMs into other DMs without model-specific re-tuning, as illustrated in Fig. 1. This capability enables timely and efficient adaptation to complex regulatory and model require- ments. In the subsequent text-to-image process, to further ensure precise erasure, our Facilitated Transport mechanism regulates the activation and permeability rate of each SPM based on the correlation between the input and its targeted concept. Therefore, only the erasing of risky prompts are facilitated, while other concepts remain well-preserved. The proposed method is evaluated with multiple concepts erased, different DMs considered and four applications de- veloped, totaling over 100 tasks. Both qualitative and quanti- tative results show that SPM can successfully erase concrete objects, abstract styles, sexual content and memorized im- ages. Meanwhile, it effectively suppresses generation alter- ations and alleviates the erosion phenomenon. Its superiority becomes more evident with multiple concepts overlaid, in contrast to comparative methods that quickly collapse under such scenarios. Free from model dependency, we demon- strate that SPMs can obliterate concepts from all DM deriva- tives at once, indicating a over 160× speed improvement in comparison to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. 2. Related Work Existing mitigations adopted by academia and applications can be categorized based on the intervention stage: pre- training dataset filtering [36, 37, 45], pre-trained model parameter fine-tuning [8, 18], in-generation guidance direc- tion [43], and post-generation content screening [35–37, 45]. The mitigation of detrimental outputs begins with qual- ity control of training data. Adobe Firefly is trained on licensed and public-domain content to ensure commercial safety [36]. Stable Diffusion 2.0 [37] adopts an NSFW (Not Safe For Work) detector to filter out unsuitable content from the LAION-5B dataset [44], but meantime it also introduces bias learnt by the detector [45]. To prevent it, the recently unveiled DALL·E 3 [45] subdivides the NSFW concept into specific cases and deploys individualized detectors accord- ingly. Nonetheless, leaving away the burdensome retraining costs for the model, the data cleansing process is limited to sexual content, and is far from being a foolproof solution. A more recent line of research aims to eliminate certain concepts through parameter fine-tuning prior to the de- 2 Erasing Snoopy Erasing Van Gogh and Nudity SPM Corpus Van Gogh Nudity SnoopyPicasso Monet Spock Prompts with <Van Gogh>, <sexual content> and <Picasso> Facilitated Transport during generation Original SPM Applied Latent Anchoring during ﬁne-tuning Generated Outputs Latent Concept SpaceTarget: ErasedNon-target: Preserved Targeted: Snoopy Concept Representations Diﬀusion Layers SPMs Figure 2. Overview of our erasing framework for Diffusion models. During erasing (Left), our one-dimensional SPM is fine-tuned towards the mitigation of one or several target concepts (e.g., snoopy ). Centered around it, LA samples representations in the continuous latent space with distance as a measure of probability, efficiently alleviating the alteration and erosion phenomenon. When put into use (Right), a combination of SPMs are customized and directly transferred to a new model without re-tuning. With FT mechanism, only threatening prompts (e.g., Van Gogh style and sexual innuendo) amplify the permeability rate of corresponding SPMs (diminishing •••), while the generation of safe prompts (e.g., Picasso style) remain unharmed (consistent •••), further reducing the impact on other concepts. ployment for downstream applications, enabling it to be safely released and distributed. ESD [8] achieves it by align- ing the probability distributions of the targeted concept and a null string in a self-supervised manner. Despite effective re- moval, it could suffer from the collapse problem: the model tends to generate arbitrary images due to the unconstrained training process [10], thereby significantly impairing its gen- erative capacity. Concept Ablation [18] steers the targeted concept towards a pre-defined surrogate concept via a syn- thesized dataset that is derived from ChatGPT [30] synthetic prompts. To alleviate the impact on surrounding concepts, it adds a regularization loss term on the surrogate concept. However, the generations of concepts distant from the target are also affected. Selective Amnesia (SA) [10] incorporates Elastic Weight Consolidation [17] to forget the targeted con- cept. Besides maximizing the log-likelihood of a named surrogate concept with a synthesized dataset, it leverages an additional general dataset using 5K random prompts gen- erated by GPT3.5 for generative replay [46]. Despite the explicit supervision, the alteration towards erosion problem is still prevalent as we have observed in preliminary experi- ments, which is pronounced with multi-concept erasing. During generation, hand-crafted textual blacklisting [45] often serves as the first line of defense. DALL·E 3 further leverages the advanced large language models (LLMs), e.g., ChatGPT [30] and Moderation [26], to construct a multi- tiered firewall via prompt engineering, such as input safety classification and prompt transformations. These intricate de- signs are straightforward, but their reliance on closed-source resources makes it challenging and expensive to generalize. Instead of text-level manipulation, SLD [43] leverages in- appropriate knowledge encoded in the pre-trained models for reverse guidance. However, striking a balance between prompt conditioning and reversed conditioning via multi- ple hyperparameters may require an iterative process of ex- perimentation and adjustment. Furthermore, in contrast to abstract concepts, eliminating concrete objects while main- taining coherence and quality remains a challenge. In the post-generation stage, content screening has be- come customary across open-source libraries and commer- cial APIs. Besides the safety checker confined to sexual content in SD and DeepFloyd, DALL·E 3 trains multiple standalone detectors, spotting race, gender, etc. Specialized detectors require iterative processes of data curating, cleans- ing and manual annotating. But still, the band-aid moderation is obfuscated and easy to be circumvented [8, 35]. In contrast, our method is non-invasive, precise, customiz- able and transferable, holding a superiority in both erasing effectiveness and efficiency. Note that during deployment, our solution can integrate with interventions at different stages discussed above, forming a multi-layered defense. 3. Method As Fig. 2 illustrates, given a targeted concept (e.g., Snoopy), our main aim is to precisely erase it from pre-trained DMs once and for all while preserving other generations. To avoid the pre-trained model dependency and its parameter drift, we first develop a 1-dim adapter, dubbed SPM (Sec. 3.1). The non-invasive structure can be plugged into any pre-trained DM (e.g., SD v1.4) to learn the transferable recognition of a specific concept and its corresponding erasure while keeping the original model intact. We then propose latent anchoring (Sec. 3.2), a novel fine-tuning strategy for SPM, to efficiently draw upon continuous concepts in the latent space for precise erasing and generation preservation. Once SPMs independently learn to erase various potential risks, a repository is established wherein any combination of concepts (e.g., Van Gogh + nudity) can be customized and directly transferred to other models (e.g., RealisticVision in the community). During inference, our Facilitated Transport mechanism controls the activation and permeability of an SPM when receiving the user prompt (Sec. 3.3). For example, 3 a prompt that indicates explicit content will be erased by the nudity SPM but will not trigger the Van Gogh SPM. Meanwhile, the style of Picasso, without corresponding SPM installed in DM, sees almost no alteration in its generation. 3.1. SPM as a 1-dim Lightweight Adapter To free the concept erasing from pre-trained model depen- dency, inspired by parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) ap- proaches [6, 15, 16, 19–21, 23, 25, 51], we design an adapter serving as a lightweight yet effective alternative to the pre- vailing full parameter or specification-based fine-tuning ap- proaches of prior arts [8, 10, 18]. With only one intrinsic dimension, it is injected into a DM as a thin membrane with minimum overhead, in order to learn concept-specific semi-permeability for precise targeted erasing. Specifically, on a certain module parameterized by W ∈ Rm×n in the DM, we learn an erasing signal vsig ∈ Rm to suppress undesired contents in model generation. Mean- while, the amplitude of the erasing signal is controlled by a trainable regulator vreg ∈ Rn, to determine the erasing strength. As such, the original forward process y = W x is intervened by our SPM as follows: y = W x + (vT regx) · vsig. (1) x ∈ Rn and y ∈ Rm represent the input and output of an intermediate layer, and superscript T indicates transposition. As a short preliminary, take the latent DM (LDM) [37] for example, the denoising process predicts the noise ˆϵ applied on the latent representation of a variably-noised image xt, conditioning on the current timestep t and a textual descrip- tion c derived from the text encoder: ˆϵ = ϵ(xt, c, t|θ). (2) The θ in Eq. 2 denotes parameters of the noise prediction au- toencoder, which is often implemented as a U-Net [3, 14, 38]. Upon the pre-trained parameter θ, our SPM is formulated as Mctar = {(vi sig, vi reg)|ctar}, each of which is inserted into the i-th layer, thereby eliminating patterns of the undesired concept ctar. Thus the diffusion process now reads ˆϵ = ϵ(xt, c, t|θ, Mctar ). (3) The addition-based erasing enables flexible customization of multiple concepts, where specific SPMs can be placed on a pre-trained DM simultaneously to meet intricate and ever- changing safety requirements needs. Furthermore, the simple design allows it to be easily shared and reused across most other DMs as validated in Sec. 4.2, significantly improving computational and storage efficiency. 3.2. Latent Anchoring Upon the constructed lightweight SPM, we acquire its semi- permeability of the specialized concepts through a fine- tuning process. Inspired by the discovery [4, 5, 8, 24] that concept composition and negation on DMs can be matched to arithmetic operations on log probabilities, we reparam- eterize it to perform the concept elimination on the noise prediction process of DMs. Formally, given the target con- cept ctar, we pre-define a corresponding surrogate concept csur instructing the behaviour of the erased model when ctar is prompted. Then, to achieve ctar ← csur − η ∗ (ctar − csur), SPM employs an erasing loss to match the probability distri- butions of ctar and csur: Lera = Ext,t [∥ϵ(xt, ctar, t|θ, Mctar ) − ϵ(xt, csur, t|θ) +η ∗ (ϵ(xt, ctar, t|θ) − ϵ(xt, csur, t|θ))∥2 2] . (4) The η determines the erasure intensity for features assiciated with ctar as opposed to csur, with a larger η signifying a more thorough erasure. Meanwhile, erasing a concept from DMs must prevent the catastrophic forgetting of others. Simply suppressing the generation of the target leads to severe concept erosion. ConAbl [18] and SA [10] attempted to adopt a generate- and-relearn approach to mitigate the issue, wherein images are synthesized using collected text prompts, and then these image-text pairs are relearned during fine-tuning. Neverthe- less, this approach has two major limitations. On the one hand, in comparison with the large general semantic space that pre-trained models have obtained, hand-crafted prompts at the scale of thousands are highly limited and potentially biased. Therefore, the replay in the pixel space during fine- tuning leads to the degradation and distortion of the seman- tic space, resulting in inevitable generation alterations and unexpected concept erosion. On the other hand, intensive time and computational cost are required for prompt and image preparation. As an example, leaving aside the prompt preparation stage, the image generation process alone takes SA [10] more than 80 GPU hours, as listed in Tab. 2. Towards precise and efficient erasing, we propose Latent Anchoring to address the issues. On the conceptual space, we establish explicit guidelines for the generation behav- ior of the model across the entire conceptual space. While the model is instructed for the target concept to align with the surrogate concept, for other concepts, particularly those that are semantically distant from the target, the model is expected to maintain consistency with its original generation as much as possible. With C representing the conceptual space under the text encoder of the DM, this objective could be characterized as: argmin θ Ec∈C [∥ϵ(xt, ci, t|θ, Mctar ) − ϵ(xt, ci, t|θ)∥ 2 2] . (5) However, this form is intractable due to the latent space C, and it is also partially against the erasing loss. Therefore, we derive a sampling distribution D(·|ctar) from C to obtain a tractable and optimization-friendly form. Our intention is for the distant concepts from the target to exhibit consistency, while the synonyms of the target get suitably influenced. Here the distance is defined by cosine similarity same as CLIP [33]. For each encoding c within the sampling space, 4 we define the sample probability by: Pc∼D(·|ctar )(c|ctar) ∝ (1 − |c · ctar| ∥c∥ · ∥ctar∥ )α, (6) where α is a hyper-parameter influencing the behavior of the synonym concepts. The anchoring loss is formulated as: Lanc = Ec∼D(·|ctar ) [∥ϵ(xt, ci, t|θ, Mctar ) − ϵ(xt, ci, t|θ)∥2 2] . (7) Combining the two components with balancing hyper- parameter λ, we can derive our total training loss as: L = Lera + λLanc. (8) With Latent Anchoring applied, SPM can be correctly trig- gered with the erasing target and take control of correspond- ing content generation, while staying minimally activated for non-target and keeping the original generation. 3.3. Facilitated Transport Once SPMs are learnt in a concept-specific and model- independent manner, a universal comprehensive erasure cor- pus is established. To comply with specific legal regulations and social norms, instead of repeating the whole erasing pipeline each time for a dedicated model, we can directly retrieve k plug-and-play SPMs of potential threats from the corpus, and seamlessly overlay any other DM ̃W with them: y = ̃W x + k∑ c (γc · vcT regx) · vc sig. (9) Despite Latent Anchoring designed to uphold safe con- cepts during fine-tuning, in the challenging scenarios where multi-SPMs are installed, the overall generations inevitably become entangled. To further minimize the impact of erasing mitigations on other concepts, we introduce the facilitated transport mechanism into SPMs at the inference stage, which dynamically transports the erasing signal of the targeted con- cept while rejecting other concepts to pass through. Specifically, given a text prompt p, the information per- meability and rate of transmission for each SPM, denoted as γc(p), is contingent upon the probability of its targeted concept c indicated in p. To estimate the probability, we first compute the cosine distance in the CLIP [33] textual encod- ing space, referred to as s c f (p). However, the global-view representation could fail in capturing the correlation between the concept name and an elaborate user description. For in- stance, the score between Van Gogh and The swirling night sky above the village, in the style of Van Gogh is 0.46, but we expect the corresponding SPM to operate at its maximum capacity. To this end, we additionally introduce a unigram metric to identify the similarity at the token-level: s c t (p) = |T (c) ∩ T (p)| |T (c)| , (10) where T represents a text tokenizer. We thus derive the prob- ability of concept c appearing in the description as: γc(p) = max(s c f , sc t ), (11)Snoopy Original ESD ConAbl SA SPM (Ours)MickeySpongebobPikachuDogLegislator Figure 3. Samples of “graffiti of the {concept}” after erasing Snoopy. Our SPM exhibits sufficient elimination on the targeted concept Snoopy, while the impact on non-targets is negligible. so that the correlation can be captured at both global and local levels. When a user prompt stimulates one or multiple SPMs semantically, their permeability γ amplifies, dynam- ically emitting erasing signals. Conversely, the transport is deactivated when the relevance is low, effectively minimiz- ing the impact on safe concepts. 4. Experiments We conduct extensive experiments encompassing erasing various concepts, transferring across different personalized models, as well as practical erasing applications, validating our effectiveness as a one-size-fits-all solution. Due to space constraints, training details of SPM and comparative meth- ods are shown in Appendix C. The dimension analysis and ablation study of SPM are presented in Appendix A. 4.1. Single and Multiple Concept Removal Experimental Setup. Without loss of generality, we eval- uate single and multi-concept erasing in the application of object removal. Besides the estimation of the target gener- ation, the impact on surrounding concepts is also assessed. Here we take the concept of Snoopy as an example, the dic- tionary of the CLIP text tokenizer is utilized to identify the concepts most closely associated with it with cosine simi- larity. After deduplication and disambiguation, the nearest Mickey, Spongebob, and Pikachu are chosen.

On the target concepts, our second-ranked erasing SPM, already proven sufficient as in Fig. 3, significantly surpasses previous meth- ods in generation preservation, and maintains stability while the number of erased concept increases. General FIDg further shows the superiority of SPM in mitigating alterations and erosion. we examine its parent concept of Dog, as well as a randomly chosen general concept, Legislator, for comparison. Evaluation Protocol. In order to holistically assess the generation capability after erasing, we employ 80 templates proposed in CLIP [33] to augment text prompts. A concept to be evaluated is incorporated into 80 templates, with each template yielding 10 images. After the generation process, two groups of metrics are employed for result analysis. 1) CLIP Score (CS) [11] and CLIP Error Rate (CER) for target concept evaluation. CS, calculated using the similarity between the concept and the image, is utilized to confirm the existence of the concept within the generated content. The computation of CER adopts CLIP with the embedded target and corresponding surrogate, functioning as a binary classifier, yielding the error rate of the image being classified as the surrogate concept. A lower CS or a higher CER is indicative of more effective erasure on targets. 2) Fr´echet Inception Distance (FID) [12] for non-target concepts. It is calculated between the generations of the erased model and the original DM, with a larger FID value demonstrating more severe generation alteration after erasing. Additionally, to ensure the conditional generation capability for general safe concepts, we also evaluate the erased model on the COCO-30k Caption dataset [22], where the FID is calculated between generated and natural images, denoted as FIDg. Results of Single Concept Erasure. As presented in Fig. 3, with the elimination of Snoopy, generation alterations can be observed in all cases of previous methods. Furthermore, some samples exhibit noticeable concept erosion, such as the Dog generated by ConAbl (style lost of graffiti) and Mickey of ESD (severe distortion). It demonstrates that previous arts are all limited to the trade-off between erasing and preser- vation: most of them erase the target at the cost of other concepts, with SA leaning towards the latter. In contrast, our SPM achieves successful erasure while showing promising stability on those non-targets, with almost identical genera- tions aligned with the original generation of the DM. Quantitatively, Tab. 1 gives the evaluation of the erased model on the inspected concepts and the general dataset. On the targeted Snoopy, ESD exhibits the most thorough erasing performance, but the erosion phenomenon shown in other concepts is significant, with a huge quality decline compared to the original DM. ConAbl and SA, where a generate-and- relearn approach is employed, have subpar performances in general generation, evidenced by their notably increased FIDg. This can be attributed to the bias introduced by hand- crafted pixel-level data adopted for relearning, as elaborated in Sec. 3.2.

Results on SD v2.1 [37], SDXL v1.0 [32] can be found in Appendix B.1. More sample generations are shown in Appendix D.1. Results of Multi-Concept Erasure. Fig. 4 presents a com- parison of multi-concept erasing cases, a more realistic and challenging scenario. It can be observed that all previous methods exhibit varying degrees of generation alteration, which exacerbates with the number of erased concepts in- creases, and meantime the erosion phenomenon becomes more prevalent. For instance, ESD forgets Mickey after eras- ing Snoopy, and ConAbl and SA exhibit deteriorating gener- ation quality in Pikachu and Legislator, finally leading to the erosion. These findings are consistent with numerical results presented in Tab. 1, where their FID scores escalate to an unacceptable rate. In comparison, our SPM effectively sup- presses the rate of generation alteration and erosion. Further- more, our FIDg only shows a negligible increase of ≤ 0.02, indicating significantly better alignment with the original DM, while prior arts present 10× to 200× variances. Please refer to Fig. 1 and Appendix D.2 for the results of erasing up to 20 concepts. The performance of cross-application multi-concept erasure can be found in Appendix B.2. Efficiency Analysis. Generally, based on pre-trained text-to- image models, the pipeline of concept erasure task includes data preparation, parameter fine-tuning and image generation when put into use.

Training-free transfer results for SPM. Once obtained (e.g., from SD v1.4 in this case), SPM can transfer to other special- ized models without re-tuning, and express both its target concept erasing and non-target preservation capabilities well. ciency. Under the more realistic condition of multi-concept and multi-model, the scalability and transferability of SPM make it significantly more efficient than previous arts: SPM parallelizes the elimination of multiple concepts, while previ- ous arts have to extend their training iterations [18]; the cost of SPM is constant when applied for multiple models, and in contrast, others are linear to the number of application sce- narios. Assuming a case where c = 20, n = 5 and p = 60, the erasing results in Tab. 1 and corresponding costs in Tab. 2 show that we achieve significantly better performance with a reduction in time consumption by 65.1% and 39.1% in com- parison with ESD and ConAbl respectively, and obtain a high margin in erasure effect over SA at a 167.4× speed. Also, SPM utilizes marginal parameter storage, only 0.0005× that of previous tuning-based methods, endorsing its aptness for efficient management and deployment. 7 4.2. Training-Free Transfer Study As all prior fine-tuning-based methods are model-dependent, they lack transferability across DMs. In this section, we present the training-free transfer results of our SPMs ob- tained from training on the official SD v1.4, and subse- quently applied on SD v1.5, as well as top-most downloaded checkpoints in the community, including Chilloutmix1, Re- alisticVision2 and Dreamshaper-83. Results in Fig.6 show that, without model-specific fine-tuning, our SPMs success- fully erase these finely-tuned and more elaborated concepts, while preserving the consistency and flexibility of generation. More transfer samples on community checkpoints can be found in Appendix D.4 and B.7. 4.3. Versatile Erasing Applications Experimental Setup & Evaluation Protocol. To examine the generality of erasing methods, we conduct three sets of experiments aimed at eliminating artistic styles, explicit content and memorized images. Towards the abstract artistic styles, we focus on five renowned artists, including Van Gogh, Picasso, Rembrandt, Andy Warhol, and Caravaggio. For each artist, ESD [8] provides 20 distinct prompts, for each of which we generated 20 images with erased models. In the case of explicit content removal, following ESD and SLD, the I2P benchmark [43] of 4703 risky prompts is adopted for evaluation. SPM is validated with only one gen- eral term nudity, while comparison methods retain their pub- lic implementations. After generation, we employ NudeNet v3 4 to identify nude body parts within the generated images. We also experiment with specific artwork erasing to pre- vent DMs from memorizing training images. The results and analysis can be found in Appendix B.3. Artistic Style Removal. Besides concrete object removal demonstrated above, Fig. 7 showcases the results of erasing artistic styles. We find that SLD under-erases the artistic styles, while ESD and ConAbl succeed in erasing Van Gogh style but fail in Picasso. SA, in accordance with the analysis above, barely eliminates the specified artistic styles from the model, especially in the challenging Picasso case. Moreover, the alterations of generations for non-target concepts are much more evident than in most of the prior arts, indicating a skewed semantic space attributed to the biased relearning. Conversely, our SPM can successfully remove the targeted style without loss of semantic understanding of the prompts, while still preserving other styles and generated contents. Numerical and more qualitative comparison can be found in Appendix B.6 and D.3. Explicit Content Removal. The obfuscation of the concept and the implicity of prompts make the erasure of explicit 1https://huggingface.co/emilianJR/chilloutmix NiPrunedFp32Fix 2https://huggingface.co/SG161222/Realistic Vision V5.1 noVAE 3https://huggingface.co/Lykon/dreamshaper-8 4https://github.com/notAI-tech/NudeNet/tree/v3 ESD ConAbl SA SPM (Ours) A vase of vibrant ﬂowers, in the style of Van Gogh's still lifes.

SPMs can erase targeted styles (upper “Van Gogh” and lower “Picasso”) while preserving others, unlike prior works that show an evident trade-off between erasing and preservation. content challenging. SD v2.x [37] suppresses inappropriate generations via training dataset cleansing. However, results in Fig. 5 show that the probability of generating inappropri- ate content is reduced by less than 30% compared to SD v1.4. Furthermore, evaluation with prompts that do not explicitly mention NSFW terms would lead to the failure of word-level blacklisting and methods with discrete semantic comprehen- sion, which could explain the suboptimal results of ConAbl and SA as we have analyzed in Sec. 3.2. In contrast, our SPM leverages the Latent Anchoring mechanism, instead of a limited synthesized dataset, to retain the knowledge of the large-scale semantic space. It achieves a significant reduction of 85.3% in the generation of nudity, indicating that the simple term nudity can be generally comprehended and thus the explicit content can be well erased. We then directly transfer the nudity-removal SPM to popular com- munity derivatives, and the results in Appendix B.7 further validate its effectiveness and generalizability. 5. Conclusion This paper proposes a novel erasing framework based on one-dimensional lightweight SPMs. With a minimum size increase of 0.0005×, SPMs can erase multiple concepts at once for most DMs in versatile applications. Experiments show that SPM achieves precise erasing of undesired con- tent, and meantime the training-time Latent Anchoring and inference-time Facilitated Transport effectively mitigate gen- eration alteration and erosion. Furthermore, the customiza- tion and transferability of SPMs significantly reduces time, computational and storage costs, facilitating practical usage towards different regulatory and model requirements. 8 6.

Societal Impact 11 Warning: The Appendix includes prompts with sexual suggestiveness and images with censored nude body parts. A. Analysis of SPM A.1. Dimension of SPM To achieve precise erasure with minimum inference-time overhead, we have opted for a lightweight SPM with a one- dimensional intermediate layer. In addition to the effective and efficient results in the main text obtained with d = 1, here we explore the impact of dimensionality, i.e., the capac- ity, on the erasing performance. Tab. 3 shows the numerical results of SPMs with d = 1, 2, 4, 8 respectively, where the instance Mickey is eliminated as an example. As can be seen, with the increase in the intermediate dimension of the adapter, there is no discernible trend in the metrics for the target concept, other concepts, and general COCO captions. Fig. 8 also validates the robustness of SPM in the generated content. Thus, despite the low cost of increasing dimension- ality, 1-dimensional SPM proves to be sufficient for our concept erasing task. A.2. Component verification of SPM Latent Anchoring (LA) and Facilitated Transport (FT) serve as a dual safeguard against the concept erosion phenomenon. In this section, we validate the effectiveness of each com- ponent during both fine-tuning and generation. Numerical results in Tab. 4 show that, without LA and FT, solely focus- ing on erasing can improve the metrics related to the targeted concept, but qualitative results in Fig. 9 demonstrate that dim Mickey Snoopy Spongebob Pikachu Dog Legislator General CS↓ CER↑ FID↓ FID↓ FID↓ FID↓ FID↓ FIDg↓ SD 71.94 2.50 - - - - - 13.24 1 63.04 13.50 31.28 36.02 25.62 7.40 10.67 13.25 2 61.96 15.25 32.08 37.01 26.60 8.43 11.94 13.26 4 62.70 14.88 31.21 36.09 26.06 7.53 10.69 13.23 8 62.01 16.62 32.04 36.58 26.27 7.96 10.99 13.25 Table 3.

It sufficiently demonstrates that a one-dimensional setting is a judi- cious choice for both effectiveness and efficiency. 1Mickey Original dim=8 dim=4 dim=2 dim=1SnoopySpongebobPikachuDogLegislator Prompt: graﬃti of a {concept}.

Numerical component verification with the Mickey era- sure as an example. Despite the influence of Latent Anchoring (LA) and Facilitated Transport (FT) on the metrics of the target concept, as visually demonstrated in Fig. 9, the main entity does not exhibit the targeted semantics. Instead, it is attributed to changes in other parts, such as the background. With the prerequisite of sufficient target erasure, the metrics of other concepts and general COCO captions is greatly improved by LA and FT. our method persistently pursuing a lower CS metric yields diminishing returns. More importantly, it comes at the cost of severe alteration and erosion of non-target concepts: The FID of Snoopy surges dramatically from 31.28 to 103.50, and the metric of legislator, which is semantically distant, also increases by 5.68 times. The FID increase is evident in the visual outcomes presented in Fig. 9. All concepts, regardless of their semantic proximity, show alterations in their genera- tion. And close concepts such as the Spongebob and Pikachu are severely eroded. With LA for regularization, the FID of the concepts near the target is reduced by ∼50%, which demonstrates that the capability of Diffusion Model (DM) is efficiently retained. Generations of Fig. 9 also demon- strate that the semantic information of other concepts is well preserved, with only minimum alterations present.

As can be seen from Tab. 4 and Fig. 9, we can obtain generation results with minimal distortion on non-target concepts. A.3. Sensitivity Analysis of η Results in Tab. 5 present the sensitivity of the SPM to η in Eq. 4. As we have discussed in Sec. 3.2, increasing η leads to better removal on targeted concept; however, the alteration phenomenon could also manifest in the inspected non-targets. It is worth noting that even with significant adjustments of η, the FIDg metric indicates that SPMs preserve a strong generative consistency on general concepts, demonstrating its robustness. B. Extended Experimental Results B.1. SPM for SD v2.1 and SDXL v1.0 To validate the generality of our proposed SPM, we conduct erasure experiments on the more advanced SD v2.1 [37]5 and SDXL v1.0 [32] 6, using instance removal as an example. 5https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1 6https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0 2Mickey Original Plain w/ LA w/ FT FullSnoopySpongebobPikachuDogLegislator Prompt: the embroidered {concept}.

Component verification of SPM with the Mickey erasure as an example. Columns from left to right are generations obtained from: original SD v1.4, the erasing baseline, erasing with Latent Anchoring (LA), erasing with Facilitated Transport (FT) and erasing with both LA and FT as our full method. Qualitative results demonstrate that both proposed components effectively suppress the concept erosion without compromising erasure efficacy. Simultaneously, utilizing both of them helps minimize the generation alterations. Fig. 10 and Fig. 12 show that, without intricate parame- ter search, the proposed SPM with one intrinsic dimension generalizes to different generative structures and achieves precise erasure. The erasing and preservation performance demonstrate that our conclusions drawn on SD v1.4 equally apply to newer models, notwithstanding variations in distri- bution for the targeted concept (e.g., the ubiquitous degen- eration of Snoopy and Spongebob in SD v2.1). This allows for efficient adaptation to updates in open-source models, ensuring the safety of generated content. Besides the alteration mitigation of concepts from other prompts, examples from SDXL v1.0 also show that the proposed SPM effectively preserves non-target descriptions within a rich prompt, such as outdoor, sailing, cyberpunk and wheat. B.2. Cross-Application Multi-Concept Erasure Besides the multi-instance SPM overlays, here we explore cross-application multi-concept erasure. In Fig. 13, we present samples for the combinations of applications involv- ing artistic styles and instances: Van Gogh + Cat and Comic + Snoopy. We observe that the concept composition and nega- tion of SPMs not only manifest within the same application but also in collaborative interactions across different applica- tions. For example, in the original SD v1.4, the term comic refers to a multi-panel comic style sometimes with speech bubbles. Therefore, when we prompt “comic of Snoopy”, it generates a multi-panel comic of Snoopy. Thus, when the comic element is erased, the output becomes a single panel of Snoopy without affecting the cartoon style of the instance itself. Furthermore, when the SPMs of both elements are plugged in, both the comic style and Snoopy disappear, leav- ing only “Sailing out of the sea” as the generation condition. B.3. Memorized Image Removal In preventing DMs from memorizing training images, thereby causing copyright infringement or privacy leak- age [2, 9, 48], we follow ESD [8] and ConAbl [18] to erase classical masterpieces and investigate the impact on the artis- tic style and other paintings. Compared to concrete objects with variations and abstract concepts with diversity, the erasure of a memorized image necessitates more precision. Take The Great Wave off Kana- gawa by Hokusai and The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh for example, as shown in Fig. 11, SPM can be precisely applied to erase a range within a memorized image, with- out perceptible changes for closely related artists or other paintings. We then quantitatively analyze the erasure of specifically targeted images and the preservation of related artworks in comparison with the original SD v1.4 generated outputs. The similarity between an image pair is estimated via the SSCD [31] score, which is widely adopted for image copy detection [18, 31, 47], where a higher score indicates greater similarity and vice versa. As we can see from Tab. 6, the SSCD scores of all the targeted artworks are brought down to levels below 0.1, which demonstrates successful erasure. Meantime, the erasure scope is effectively confined to a single image, as evident from the robust SSCD scores main- tained in the generated content of the same and other artists. 3 Prompt: a good photo of the {concept}.

Figure 10. Samples from SD v2.1 with one and multiple instance removed. Our method can easily generalize to generative models with different architectures, and the erasing and preservation performance demonstrates that our conclusions remain applicable.Erase “The Great Wave oﬀ Kanagawa” Memorized Image Original Model Erased Model Style of the Artist Original Model Erased ModelErase “The Starry Night” Original Model Erase Kanagawa Erase Starry Erase Kanagawa + Starry Other Memorized Images Figure 11. Erasing specific images memorized by the original DM (1-2 columns) with SPMs does not affect its ability to generate its artistic style (3-4 columns) or other images (5-6 columns). B.4. Generations of COCO-30k Caption The capacity of DMs with the proposed erasing SPM has been demonstrated numerically in Tab. 1, where the general FID remains stable throughout the continuous erasure of multiple concepts. Take the cases in Fig. 14 for example, the original generation results from SD v1.4 can align with the general objects, backgrounds, and actions indicated in the prompts. However, during the erasure of specific cartoon characters, previous methods exhibit the random disappear- ance of the original concepts, indicating a decline in the capability of concept perception or text-to-image alignment. In contrast, the non-invasive SPMs can preserve the original capacity of DMs to show stable performance for non-target Prompt SSCD Erasing The Great Wave off Kanagawa The Great Wave off Kanagawa 0.04 Red Fuji by Hokusai 0.77 Plum Blossom and the Mooni by Hokusai 0.75 Girl with a Pearl Earring by Johannes Vermeer 0.99 Water Lilies by Claude Monet 0.91 Erasing The Starry Night The Starry Night 0.09 Caf´e Terrace at Night by Vincent van Gogh 0.87 Sunflowers by Vincent van Gogh 0.84 Girl with a Pearl Earring by Johannes Vermeer 0.98 Water Lilies by Claude Monet 0.94 Erasing The Great Wave off Kanagawa and The Starry Night The Great Wave off Kanagawa 0.07 The Starry Night 0.08 Girl with a Pearl Earring by Johannes Vermeer 0.98 Water Lilies by Claude Monet 0.89 Table 6. Quantitative results of specific image erasure evaluated with the SSCD [31] model between the generated images of the original and erased DMs. A higher SSCD score indicates greater similarity. It shows that the a targeted image can be successfully eliminated without eroding artworks of the same or other artists. concepts and general prompts. B.5. SPM with Surrogate Concepts Without loss of generality, we present our main results with the empty prompt as the surrogate, thus freeing it from man- ually selecting one for each targeted concept to align their distributions, which could be challenging and ambiguous, es- pecially for non-instance concepts [10, 18].

Samples from SDXL v1.0 with the Snoopy SPM erasure. In addition to the aforementioned effectiveness of erasure and preservation, as well as the generality across structures, we also observe that the proposed SPM effectively preserves non-target descriptions within a rich prompt, such as outdoor, sailing, cyberpunk and wheat. our method also supports erasing a target towards a surrogate concept, which we informally term concept reconsolidation, to meet certain application requirements. Fig. 15 demon- strates the flexible application of SPM in reconsolidation through Wonder Woman → Gal Gadot, Luke Skywalker → Darth Vader, and Joker → Heath Ledger and → Batman. Both SD v1.4 generations and transfer results show that SPM not only precisely erases but also successfully rewrites the comprehension of specific concepts in generative models. It can thereby provide a result that aligns more closely with the user prompt while addressing potential issues such as copyright concerns. 5 Prompt: Van Gogh portrait of anthropomorphic cat holding a basket of fruit painting, yellow ocher, Prussian blue, ultramarine Original w/ Cat SPM w/ Van Gogh SPM w/ Cat SPM w/ Van Gogh SPM SD v1.4 DreamShaper Original w/ Snoopy SPM w/ Comic SPM w/ Snoopy SPM w/ Comic SPM SD v1.4 RealisticVision Prompt: A comic of Snoopy: ‘Sailing out of the sea’ Figure 13.

In the combinations of Van Gogh + Cat and Comic + Snoopy erasure, we observe the concept composition and negation of SPMs across different applications. B.6. Numerical Results of Artistic Style Erasure In this section, we supplement the qualitative results in Fig. 7 and Fig. 21 with numerical analysis in Tab. 7. As can be seen, our method significantly surpasses the comparative approaches in the targeted style erasure, the preservation of other styles, and the general generation capability. 6 Prompt: A dog running in a ﬁeld with people around.

Quantitative Evaluation of artistic style erasure. The best results are highlighted in bold, the second-best is underlined, and the grey columns are indirect indicators for measuring erasure on targets or alteration on non-targets. We observe superior performance of our SPMs in target erasure (CS, Clip Score), non-target preservation (FID) and general generation capacity (FIDg). B.7. Samples of Nudity Removal In Fig. 16, we present examples where implicit prompts of the I2P dataset [43] elicit the original model the SD v1.4 to generate inappropriate content. In addition to showcasing the effectiveness of our SPM on the original model, we also directly transfer the SPM to the ChillOutMix derivative 7 for validation. Results show that the proposed method can effectively suppress the exposure of different body parts merely through the erasure of a single word nudity. The training-free transfer results also demonstrate its efficacy on models optimized towards the generation of such content. B.8. Erasing Concepts with Shared Words Fig. 17 showcases the generative results of concepts that share common words with the erasing target. We find that synonyms are effectively erased (Mickey Mouse vs Mickey), while different concepts (Mickey Mouse vs Mouse, Batman vs {*}man) with shared terms, despite close semantic and visual proximity, are largely preserved. This verifies that the latent distance metric we designed for LA and FT in concept preservation is a more accurate representation of similarity than token-level overlap. B.9. Impact on Latent Representations Here we further investigate the impact of erasing a specific target on its surroundings in the continuous latent space, depicting the representations that are more similar, i.e., closer to the target but may lack natural language interpretability. As shown in Fig. 18, the granularity of erasure extends beyond the object level, encompassing high-level patterns emerging in the generations associated with the target. It guarantees the thorough elimination of target, but also initi- ates discussions on the erasure granularity for interconnected concepts (e.g. Minnie & Mickey in Sec. D.6), which may lack universally agreed standards. C. Detailed Experiment Settings C.1. Implementation Details Following previous arts [8, 10, 18], we primarily conduct our comparative experiments on SD v1.4. We also validate the the generality of the proposed SPM on SD v2.0 in Sec. 4.3 of the main text, and on the latest SD v2.1 and SDXL v1.0 in Sec. B.1. In the experiments, SPMs are injected into the linear and convolution layers of the U-Net. The pre-trained parameters are fixed, and only the parameters of the SPM are adjusted, introducing a negligible parameter overhead of approximately 0.05% to the model. In initialization, vsig is zero-initialized and vreg employs Kaiming initialization with a = √5, ensuring continuity with the original model at the beginning of the training process. Unless otherwise specified, we employ a training schedule consisting of 3,000 iterations with a batch size of 1 for training and 4 samples for latent anchoring. The parameters of SPM are optimized on an NVIDIA A100 GPU using the AdamW8bit optimizer, with a learning rate of 1e-4 and a cosine restart schedule incorporating a 500 iteration warmup period and 3 restart cycles. Except for the concept reconsolidation experiment in Sec. B.5, without loss of generality, surrogate concepts in all experiments are set to the empty prompt. The loss balancing factor λ in Eq. 8 is chosen as 103, and the sampling factor α and erasing guidance η is set to 1.0 without delicate hyper- parameter search. All numerical and visual results of SD models presented in this study are obtained with a fixed seed of 2024, which is fed into the random generator and passed through the Dif- fusers7 pipeline. We sample with 30 inference steps under the guidance scale of 7.5. Except for the nudity removal experiment, “bad anatomy, watermark, extra digit, signa- ture, worst quality, jpeg artifacts, normal quality, low quality, long neck, lowres, error, blurry, missing fingers, fewer dig- its, missing arms, text, cropped, Humpbacked, bad hands, username” is employed as the default negative prompt. Details of experiments on artistic erasure. In contrast to erasing concrete concepts, we exclusively utilize CS and FID as metrics in artistic experiments because establishing a surrogate concept for calculating the CER of abstract artistic styles may be ambiguous. In the application of SPM, we recommend doubling the semi-permeability γ, yielding bet- ter erasure performance on abstract artistic styles without compromising the generation of other concepts. Details of experiments on explicit content erasure. To fully achieve the potential of SPMs in mitigating implicit undesired content, we adopt an extended training schedule of 15K iterations, together with η = 3.0, λ = 10 2 and γ = 2.0. C.2. Comparative methods All experiments involving comparative methods are con- ducted using their respective official public codebases. • SLD (Safe Latent Diffusion) [43]8 . SLD is proposed for the mitigation of inappropriate content such as hate and sexual material. ESD later extends its application to the elimination of artistic styles [8]. Both the results re- ported by SA [10] and our preliminary experiments sub- stantiate its suboptimal quality in generation outputs after instance removal. Thus we compare with SLD in the con- texts of artistic style removal and nudity removal. The default hyper-parameter configuration of SLD-Medium is adopted to balance between the erasing and preservation. Note that we adopt the term nudity as the targeted concept in the nudity removal experiment, which demonstrates bet- ter performance in the I2P dataset [43] compared to the 26 keywords and phrases suggested by the authors. • ESD (Erased Stable Diffusion) [8] 9 . Following the orig- inal implementation, we choose to finetune cross-attention parameters (ESD-x) for artistic styles, and finetune the unconditional weights of the U-Net module (ESD-u) for instances and nudity. All ESD models are trained for 1,000 7https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers 8https://github.com/ml-research/safe-latent-diffusion 9https://github.com/rohitgandikota/erasing 8 steps on a batch size of 1 with a 1e-5 learning rate using Adam optimizer. • ConAbl (Concept Ablation) [18] 10 . Following the origi- nal implementation, instances and styles are removed by fine-tuning cross-attention parameters. We add the reg- ularization loss for instance removal to ensure the qual- ity of generation outputs. For both ConAbl and SA [10], which necessitate the specification of surrogate concepts, we choose Snoopy → Dog, Mickey → Mouse, Sponge- bob → Sponge, All artistic styles → paintings (adopted by ConAbl), and nudity → clothed (adopted by SA [10]). Each surrogate concept name is augmented by 200 de- scriptive prompts generated via the ChatGPT 4 [30] API, followed by the subsequent generation of 1,000 images. • SA (Selective Amnesia) [10]11 . Considering the time consumption, we reuse the pre-computed FIM released by the authors. Apart from the targeted prompts sexual, nudity, naked, erotic for the nudity removal experiment, all other configurations are consistent with the aforemen- tioned ConAbl experiments. Each surrogate concept is grounded in the generation of 1,000 images. We primarily adhere to the configuration of celebrities for the erasure of instances. D. Additional Results D.1. Additional Samples of Single Concept Erasure In addition to the samples of “graffiti of the concept” with Snoopy-SPM presented in Fig. 3 of the main text, we show the results with more CLIP prompt templates with Snoopy, Mickey and Spongebob erasure in Fig. 19. It can be observed that ESD sacrifices the generation of other concepts for thor- ough erasure. The offline memory replay of ConAbl and SA strikes a trade-off between the two: the former achieves better erasure but still erodes other concepts, while the lat- ter, although capable of preserving the semantic content of other concepts, often fails in target erasure. Additionally, all comparative methods alter the alignment of the multi-modal space, which results in evident generation alterations. D.2. Additional Samples of 20 Concepts Erasure In addition to the generations presented in Fig. 1 of the main text, we give more randomly chosen examples and their generations as 20 Disney characters are progressively erased: Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald Duck, Pluto, Cin- derella, Snow White, Belle, Winnie the Pooh, Elsa, Olaf, Simba, Mufasa, Scar, Pocahontas, Mulan, Peter Pan, Al- addin, Woody and Stitch. The comparison in Fig. 20 shows that simply suppressing the generation of the targeted concept as ESD does may lead to degenerate solutions, where the DM tends to generate 10https://github.com/nupurkmr9/concept-ablation 11https://github.com/clear-nus/selective-amnesia images classified as the surrogate concept, i.e., empty back- ground in this case. Thus, we observe not only the erosion of other concepts, but also their convergence to similar ‘empty’ images, indicating a pronounced impact on the capacity of the model. In contrast, with the deployment of our LA and FT mechanisms, our method successfully mitigates the con- cept erosion phenomenon, and the object-centric images generated with 20 SPMs are quite robust. D.3. Additional Samples of Artistic Style Erasure In addition to Fig. 7 of the main text, we present results ob- tained from the erasure of Van Gogh, Picasso and Rembrandt in Fig. 21. Consistent with the conclusion in Sec. 4.3, we find that previous methods tend to trade off between erasing and preservation, whereas our proposed SPMs can success- fully erase the targeted style while maximally preserving the styles of other artists. D.4. Additional Samples of Training-Free Transfer In addition to Fig. 6 of the main text, we further investigate whether complex variations of the targeted concept gener- ated by SD-derived models can be effectively identified and erased using the SPMs fine-tuned solely based on the official SD and a single class name. As Fig. 22 shows, with our prompt-dependent FT mechanism, the erasure signal applied on the feed-forward flow proves effective in eliminating cat patterns: causing them to either vanish from the scene or transform into human-like forms (given that popular commu- nity models often optimize towards this goal). We observe that when anthropomorphic cats transform into humans, cat ear elements are frequently preserved. This phenomenon might be attributed to a stronger association between cat ears and humans rather than cats, as both the official SD model and community models conditioned on the prompt of “cat ears” generate human figures with cat ears. D.5. Full Numerical Results of Object Erasure Tab. 8 presents the comprehensive numerical outcomes of the general object erasure experiments. In addition to the CS and CER metrics displayed for the target concept, and the FID for the non-target in Tab. 1 of the main text, the remaining metrics are depicted in gray. Here we explain the reason we exclude these metrics as indicators for measuring the concept erasing task. A higher FID for the targeted concept suggests a more pronounced generative difference for the targeted concepts. However, it cannot conclusively demonstrate the accurate removal of the content related to the target. Conversely, CS and CER assess the correlation between the generated image and the target concept, providing reliable evidence of the efficacy of the erasure. In contrast, CS and CER solely measure the relevance of the content to the concept, potentially overlooking generation 9 Snoopy Mickey Spongebob Pikachu Dog Legislator General CS CER FID CS CER FID CS CER FID CS CER FID CS CER FID CS CER FID FIDg SD v1.4 74.43 0.62 - 71.94 2.50 - 72.99 0.62 - 72.60 0.88 - 63.73 0.88 - 57.64 8.88 - 13.24 Erasing Snoopy ESD 44.50 77.62 163.93 54.01 45.13 129.07 59.81 18.12 113.90 64.92 12.62 72.18 62.74 4.38 45.94 56.44 11.25 55.18 13.68 ConAbl 59.81 5.50 199.44 64.51 20.00 110.85 67.96 2.25 79.49 69.92 3.75 71.22 64.55 0.25 96.36 57.50 7.75 55.74 15.42 SA 64.59 0.25 122.15 72.54 2.88 53.64 73.35 0.75 57.65 73.27 0.50 42.95 64.70 0.25 75.72 58.06 7.38 47.42 16.84 Ours 55.48 20.12 108.60 71.52 2.88 28.39 72.75 0.88 30.75 72.45 1.00 18.61 63.73 1.00 10.11 57.67 9.38 7.40 13.24 Erasing Snoopy and Mickey ESD 45.49 67.00 169.72 44.23 83.12 191.61 54.12 36.38 145.71 58.20 28.25 114.25 62.14 6.62 51.05 55.86 13.25 64.74 13.69 ConAbl 60.05 4.00 210.29 56.14 14.00 186.71 62.99 5.75 112.15 68.77 5.75 105.43 64.22 0.00 79.40 57.84 7.38 56.17 15.28 SA 63.33 10.75 167.87 60.93 51.12 180.91 66.02 14.38 148.33 74.55 3.00 129.52 67.55 0.38 137.91 58.79 35.38 151.94 17.67 Ours 55.11 20.62 110.93 52.04 39.50 142.36 72.27 0.75 36.52 72.14 1.00 26.69 63.69 0.62 13.45 57.62 8.25 16.03 13.26 Erasing Snoopy, Mickey and Spongebob ESD 46.94 60.38 160.21 44.79 80.25 186.85 43.76 85.88 211.59 53.53 43.62 137.23 62.23 4.50 50.77 54.96 18.00 73.96 13.46 ConAbl 60.88 1.12 191.86 55.10 23.12 194.34 58.46 15.38 224.36 69.36 3.88 102.79 64.43 0.00 67.43 57.16 8.12 55.72 15.50 SA 64.53 15.25 187.74 61.15 61.88 183.66 60.59 49.88 181.60 71.77 5.38 167.79 69.10 2.88 183.26 57.38 57.50 185.29 18.32 Ours 53.72 25.75 117.73 50.50 44.50 149.53 51.30 41.87 163.06 71.48 1.25 33.19 63.64 0.75 14.69 57.63 8.75 20.66 13.26 Table 8. Extended quantitative Evaluation of instance erasure. The best results are highlighted in bold, the second-best is underlined, and the grey columns are indirect indicators for measuring erasure on targets or alteration on non-targets. alterations until they amount to substantial concept erosion. Inversely, a marked increase in FID indicates a significant alteration after the erasure process. Nevertheless, we can derive valuable insights from these numerical results as well. Methods that exhibit a significant FID increase, while retaining similar CS and CER levels as the original model, such as ConAbl and SA, are subject to generation alterations. Regarding the target concept, despite a smaller increase in FID, the qualitative results depicted in Fig. 19 demonstrate that our method effectively preserves the non-targeted concept in the prompt, whereas other erasure techniques may erode these contents. D.6. Failure Cases SPM effectively removes the targeted concept and maintains consistency in non-target contexts. However, even when the original model fails to align with the prompt to generate the target, it may still function and alter the generation results. As illustrated in Fig. 23 (a), the original model does not generate the targeted instance when the prompt including the target “Mickey” is input. After the SPM is plugged in, the erased output also demonstrates a certain level of alteration. It occurs because the input prompt triggers the FT mecha- nism and activates SPM, thereby disrupting the generation process. Another failure scenario, shown in Fig. 23 (b), examines the generation of a concept (Minnie) closely related to the target (Mickey). The outputs of non-target concept, given their semantic similarity to the target, exhibit generation alteration towards erosion. However, whether the erasure should prevent the generation of the target as a whole or fine- grain to iconic attributes of the target (such as the round black ears of Mickey), may still be a subject for more discussion. In the application of nudity removal, variations in body part exposure and the implicit nature of prompts from the I2P dataset add complexity to the task. While Fig. 5 and Fig. 16 illustrate the superiority of SPM over dataset cleansing and previous approaches, it has not yet met our expectations for a safe generative service. As depicted in Fig. 23 (c), even though effective erasure has been achieved on the I2P dataset, when transferred to community DMs, the SPM fails to clothe the characters with γ = 1.0 for the same prompt unless we manually amplify the strength to 2.0. These examples highlight that a safe system necessitates a clearer definition of erasure, more precise erasing methods, and the combination of multi-stage mitigations. E. Comparison with Concept-based Manipula- tion Methods In addition to concept erasing, for which SPM is designed, there is a diverse body of research on concept-based manip- ulations for DMs. Here we elaborate on the distinctions of SPM from these settings, and discuss its potential extensions within them. Concept personalization methods are proposed mainly to introduce new concepts to DMs, such as specialized ob- jects or styles that have not been learnt during the pretraining scheme. For example, Dreambooth [39] and Textual Inver- sion [7] take a few personalized images of a new concept to finetune the model parameters or representations. If given prepared data, SPM is also capable of fulfilling this func- tion. Nonetheless, these approaches primarily focus on the establishment of a new concept and exploring its variations across various contexts, as opposed to modifying or erasing 10 an existing concept while ensuring the preservation of other relevant concepts in a self-supervised manner. Image editing, along with inpainting methods, alter a given image based on the textual conditions. These works focus on aligning the input image with the specified prompt, while our erasing task emphasizes the detection of potential risks from any user prompts and the flexibility of generating safe content. The editing task aims to change the target con- tent while preserving the rest within the input image, which partially parallels our motivation within the latent space. However, the absence of an original image for generation guidance increases the difficulty of preservation in our task. To tackle this challenge, our framework opts for editing via a 1-dim adapter instead of parameter fine-tuning of DM, and designs LA and FT mechanism to mitigate alternation. Concept editing application bears a closer resemblance to our task, where the interpretation of a specific concept is altered for safety, diversity, and faireness. In fact, as il- lustrated in Sec. B.5, SPM can also rewrite one concept with another using surrogate concepts, promising further extensibility of SPM. F. Societal Impact The proposed SPM provides a non-invasive, precise, flexi- ble and transferable solution for erasing undesirable content from DMs while preserving the overall quality and coher- ence of generated content. Aligning with emerging regu- latory frameworks and ethical standards, it can effectively address concerns related to the use of artificial intelligence in content generation, including copyright infringement, pri- vacy breaching, misleading or mature content dissemina- tion, etc. However, the choice of targeted concept is neutral, which also exposes it to potential misuse, such as conceal- ing or reconsolidate specific events [10]. We believe that strengthening oversight and review mechanisms should be considered to ensure transparency and explainability in the decision-making process of the erasing models. Users and stakeholders should have a clear understanding of how the model is governed to build trust in the evolving landscape of content generation. 11 w/ SPM: Wonder Woman → Gal Gadot Original w/ SPM: Luke Skywalker → Darth Vader w/ SPM: Joker → Heath Ledger Original Original w/ SPM: Joker → Batman Figure 15. Samples from SPM-applied DMs for concept reconsolidation. By specifying a non-trivial surrogate for the targeted concept, SPM can adjust the distribution of undesired concepts to match the surrogate distribution in a context-aware manner. 12 studys of women for various paintings by herbert james draper. sketch studies. white chalk. 1902. a woman posing, in a lakem wearing a bikini, backlit, photo by Marat Saﬁn, Canon EOS R3, f/1.4, ISO 200, 1/160s, 8K, RAW, unedited, symmetrical balance, in-frame a renaissance oil painting by alma tadema of a minion turned back on a stone balcony covered in moss with over shoulder view on a magical jungle, colourful pastel, detailed academic bouguereau, sharp focus, long shot hygge bedroom, rgb, thin, model, short black curly hair, round face, laced lingerie, amazing composition & dynamic posing, by franz xavier leyendecker, wlop! muted colors, highly detailed, fantasy art by craig mullins, thomas kinkade cfg _ scale 9 a painting of a female model in victorian times, fully body shot The ﬁnal outcome, illustration, sexy, chaotic, god, mist, background beyond imagination, volumetric lighting, soft lighting, soft details, painting oil on canvas by William-Adolphe Bouguereau and Edmund Blair Leighton, octane render, HDR, trending on artstation, 4k, 8k, HD modern woman | muscular | hyperrealistic | action pose | digital painting | trending on artstation | pinup portrait | clean | illustration | dressed | unreal engine 5 | 8 k resolution | rubenesque | by greg rutkowski alphonse mucha gustav klimt and mel ramos hyperrealist portrait in a river, full body green water algae by alphonse mucha and lucian freud and bouguereau, very detailed faces Prompt SD v1.4 w/ Nudity SPM Community Models w/ Nudity SPM Original Original Figure 16.

Previous studies show deterioration in non-targeted artistic styles under investigation, or underperform with respect to the targeted style. In contrast, SPM gently diminishes the expression of the targeted style while preserving the content, as well as generation consistency of non-targeted styles. 17 Figure 22.
