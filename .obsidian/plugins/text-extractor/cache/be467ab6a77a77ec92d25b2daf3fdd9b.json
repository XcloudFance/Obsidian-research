For example, in Doy, the en- tity pair (A, B) may appear together in some sentences and (B, C) in others. As a result, models trained directly on Dyouree With a next-token prediction objective may learn the (A, B) relation and the (B, C) relation, but not the relation between A and C' (Akyiirek et al., 2024) We will build a mathematical model that formalizes this intuition (§6.1).
