It allows engineers to plan modifications or repairs to a plant in complete : safety and to try out different scenarios first before implementing them. One : of the devices used is a virtual reality headset which gives the engineer the : feeling of being there. We will now describe how these devices work. » Video is sent from a computer to the headset (either using an HDMI cable or a smartphone fitted into the headset). : » Two feeds are sent to an LCD/OLED display (sometimes two screens are used, one for the left side of the image and one for the right side of the : image); lenses placed between the eyes and the screen allow for focusing : and reshaping of the image/video for each eye, thus giving a 3D effect and : adding to the realism. » Most headsets use 110° field of view which is enough to give a pseudo 360° : surround image/video. : » A frame rate of 60 to 120 images per second is used to give a true/realistic : image. : » As the user moves their head (up and down or left to right), a series of sensors and/or LEDs measure this movement, which allows the image/video : on the screen to react to the user’s head movements (sensors are usually : gyroscopic or accelerometers; LEDs are used in conjunction with mini : cameras to further monitor head movements). » Headsets also use binaural sound (surround sound) so that the speaker : output appears to come from behind, from the side or from a distance, : giving very realistic 3D siund.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
