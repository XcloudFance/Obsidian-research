KEYWORDS Diffusion Model, Machine Unlearning, and Adversarial Attack 1 INTRODUCTION Developing Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) is a double-edged sword. Although text-to-image (T2I) generative mod- els [10, 19, 22, 25, 26, 37] can generate high-quality and diverse images according to the given prompts, they also raise significant safety concerns regarding identity privacy [2], copyright [29], and Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content [23, 27]. For example, these models can generate portraits of celebrities known as deepfakes [30], while some painting styles of artists can be imitated. Besides, these models can generate Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content, such as nudity and violence. To mitigate these issues, as shown in Figure 1, concept erasure methods [5, 7, 8, 12, 15, 39] for erasing the involved concepts have been developed, falling under the cate- gory of machine unlearning [14, 18, 28, 32, 34]. However, existing methods accomplish the “erasure” task by shifting the text-to-image mapping and fail to erase the visual content within the generative space of diffusion models, leaving a fatal flaw for restoring these erased concepts. This inspires the question: How trustworthy are unlearning methods for text-to-image diffusion models? Previous methods are sub-optimal for this question from two perspectives. (1) Lack of transferability: Some methods operate within a white-box setting, requiring access to the unlearned model. And the learned adversarial input often fails to transfer to other unlearned models for concept restoration. As shown in Figure 1, methods like UnlearnDiff [41] make a strong assumption that the unlearned generative model is accessible, which lacks transferabil- ity and is less practical in real-world scenarios. (2) Limited attack: The prompt-level methods struggle to restore narrow concepts from unlearned models, such as celebrity identity (ID). As depicted in Figure 1, UnlearnDiff [41] tries to optimize an adversarial prompt to restore the target concept (i.e., “Barack Obama”). But its repre- sentative capability is constrained by the discrete nature of prompt tokens, making accurate identity restoration challenging. In this paper, we aim to probe the erasure robustness of unlearned diffusion models under the black-box setting, where the attacker lacks knowledge of the unlearning methods and the unlearned models are inaccessible for the optimization. This is significantly challenging, especially for narrow concepts such as identity. We first analyze the reasons for the poor transferability of previous method. To tackle this challenge, we utilize an adversarial search strategy to find the adversarial embedding transferable across dif- ferent unlearned models. This strategy adopts an original Stable Diffusion model as a surrogate model to alternately erase and search for embeddings, guiding the embedding search from high-density regions to low-density ones. These embeddings located in low- density regions are difficult to erase, enabling them to restore the target concept for different unlearned methods. Our contributions are summarized as follows: • We propose a transferable adversarial attack to probe the unlearning robustness, which can transfer across diverse unlearned models and tackle the challenge of ID restoration. • We improve the transferability by iteratively erasing and searching for the embeddings that can restore the target concept. The obtained embeddings are located in low-density regions and very likely to be overlooked by erasure methods, thus possessing greater restoration capabilities. • Extensive experiments demonstrate the transferability of the searched adversarial embedding across various state-of-the- art unlearning methods, along with its effectiveness across diverse levels of concepts ranging from broad to narrow. 2 RELATED WORK 2.1 Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Text-to-Image (T2I) Diffusion models are a variant of diffusion mod- els, providing text-conditional guidance for image generation. The training of diffusion models includes two processes [13, 31]. In the diffusion process, noise is gradually added to the image 𝑥0 over multiple steps. In the reverse process [16, 17, 31], the model learns to predict the noise given the time step 𝑡 and the noised version image 𝑥𝑡 . T2I diffusion models [10, 22, 25] typically conduct the diffusion and reverse process in the latent space [4] of lower di- mension for better computation efficiency. And various conditional mechanisms [25, 36, 40] (such as text prompt), are introduced for diverse controllable T2I generation. But the inappropriate text input can result in undesirable generated images [27, 35, 38], prompting the development of concept erasure methods to address this issue. 2.2 Diffusion Unlearning for Concept Erasure A direct way to remove undesirable concepts is to filter out the inappropriate images and use the remaining data to retrain the model. But it is hard to find a perfect classifier to detect inappropri- ate images, and retraining the model from scratch requires large amounts of computation resources. Therefore, existing unlearning methods focus on erasing concepts from the trained model. Erased Stable Diffusion (ESD) [7] guides the predicted noise in the opposite direction of the target concept (i.e., the concept to erase) to decrease the probability of target concept generation. Concept Ablation (CA) guides the distribution of target concept towards a broader concept called the anchor concept. Forget-Me-Not (FMN) [39] doesn’t direct the target concept distribution to a specified distribution; instead, it minimizes the attention map corresponding to the target con- cept. Unlike the above fine-tuning-based methods, Unified Concept Editing (UCE) [8] is a model editing method that applies a closed- form editing to the liner projection weights of cross-attention parts.

We adopt the original Stable Diffusion model as a surrogate model to alternately erase and search for embeddings which can restore the target concepts. under benign input, their reliability under adversarial scenarios requires further investigation. 2.3 Adversarial Concept Restoration UnlearnDiff attack [41] uses the classifier nature of diffusion models and employs Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to optimize in the token space for concept restoration. But it requires access to the unlearned model. In contrast, Ring-A-Bell [33] assumes that the un- learned model is inaccessible and utilizes the text encoder to search for adversarial prompts. It employs prompts with and without the target concept to obtain its representation in the embedding space, then utilizes a genetic algorithm to search for adversarial prompts in the discrete token space. While Ring-A-Bell mainly focuses on NSFW content, it overlooks the probe of narrower concepts like celebrity identity. Pham et al. [20] probe a wide range of concepts, including celebrity identity, artist styles and NSFW content, with the aid of Textual Inversion [6]. However, they also require access to the unlearned model like [41]. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we exploit the transferability of adversarial em- bedding to probe the restoration of diverse concepts, particularly narrow ones, without needing access to the unlearned model during the optimization process. 3 METHOD In this section, we first introduce the preliminaries for the Stable Diffusion model, and explain how to conduct concept restoration at the embedding level. Then, we analyze the reasons for the poor transferability of the naive method and present the motivation behind the proposed strategy for improving transferability. Finally, we introduce the formulation and implementation of this strategy. 3.1 Preliminaries Stable Diffusion. We focus on the widely employed latent diffusion models [25], also known as Stable Diffusion. In the training process, the image 𝑥 undergoes encoding through the encoder E, yielding its latent representation 𝑧 = E (𝑥). Subsequently, Gaussian noise is gradually added to 𝑧0, generating a sequence of noised versions of the latent representation {𝑧1, 𝑧2, . . . , 𝑧𝑇 }, where 𝑇 denotes the total number of time steps. The training objective is to predict the Gaussian noise 𝜖 as follows: L = E𝑧∼E (𝑥 ),𝑦,𝜖∼N (0,1),𝑡 [∥𝜖 − 𝜖𝜃 (𝑧𝑡 , T𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑦), 𝑡)∥2 2], (1) where 𝑦 represents the token embeddings of the input prompt, T𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 denotes the text encoder used to obtain the conditional guidance of 𝑦, 𝑡 is the current time step, and 𝜃 denotes model parameters. Concept Restoration. To restore the target concept from the un- learned model parameterized by ˆ𝜃 , Pham et al. [20] utilized Textual Inversion [6] to obtain the adversarial embedding for restoration. Concretely, they replaced the target concept in the input prompt with the placeholder token 𝑆∗ (e.g., \"a photo of <target-concept>\" is modified as \"a photo of 𝑆∗\"), and optimized the corresponding embedding of 𝑆∗ denoted by 𝑣. The modified prompt is then fed into the text encoder to obtain the new text condition T𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑦′, 𝑣), where 𝑦′ denotes the token embeddings of the original prompt but without the target concept (e.g., \"a photo of\"). Pham et al. [20] ap- plied Textual Inversion to the unlearned model to find the optimal embedding for the token 𝑆∗ by solving the optimization problem below: 𝑣 ∗ = arg min 𝑣 E𝑧∼E (𝑥 ),𝑦′,𝜖∼N (0,1),𝑡 [∥𝜖 − 𝜖 ˆ𝜃 (𝑧𝑡 , T𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑦′, 𝑣), 𝑡)∥2 2] (2) where 𝑣 ∗ denotes the learned adversarial embedding. The method proposed by Pham et al. [20] proves effective for restoring diverse concepts, including narrow ones such as celebrity identity, which are challenging to restore using prompt-level attack methods such as Ring-A-Bell [33] and UnlearnDiff [41] due to the discrete nature of text representation. However, Pham et al. [20] made a strong assumption that the attacker had access to unlearned models. In this paper, we aim to perform concept restoration with access only to the original Stable Diffusion model (i.e., the model xx, xx, xx Xiaoxuan Han, Songlin Yang, Wei Wang, Yang Li, and Jing Dong SD (w/ AS) SD (w/o AS) UCE ESD FMN CA Figure 3: The visualization of the embeddings obtained from different unlearned models for the restoration of “Barack Obama”.

Concept restoration aims to find the embedding capable of restoring the target concept within the model. A naive approach involves directly applying Textual Inversion [6] to the original model. However, as illustrated in Fig- ure 3, the scatter plot displays that embeddings, represented by cyan, blue, yellow, purple, and green points, obtained from a single model—whether it is the original or an unlearned one—tend to ex- hibit distinctly separated cluster distributions. In other words, these embeddings obtained from the original model are highly likely to be ineffective for unlearned models. One possible explanation is that, for the original model, the learned embedding closely resem- bles the token embedding of the target concept, thus having a high probability of being erased. The transferable embedding we seek needs to diverge from the token embedding of the target concept. However, the embedding optimized for the original model may be stuck around the token embedding of the target concept due to the local minimum nature inherent in gradient-based optimization methods. Hence, additional guidance is necessary to facilitate the optimization process and explore more potential regions. How to Improve Transferability? In the continuous embedding space, the distribution of the target concept may conform to a spe- cific distribution, with high-density regions likely centered around the token embedding of the target concept. Given that most un- learning methods [7, 8, 15] utilize the token of the target concept for erasure, these high-density regions are mostly erased. Conse- quently, the transferable embedding for target concept restoration is likely to reside in low-density regions. Thus we need to guide the embedding search from high-density regions to low-density ones. To achieve this, we employ an Adversarial Search (AS) strategy. This strategy initially seeks the embedding from the original model, attempts to erase it, and then repeats the process of embedding search and erasure iteratively. After a number of iterations, we can obtain a series of embeddings, among which lies the transferable one. As depicted in Figure 3 by the red points, after applying our adversarial search strategy, it is possible to avoid falling into the distribution of a single model. Therefore, the red portion exhibits a bar-like distribution, showing a tendency to intersect with all distributions where restorations are successful.

Adversarial search is formulated as a Min- Max optimization process, expressed as follows: min 𝑣 max 𝜃 E𝑧∼E (𝑥 ),𝑦′,𝜖∼N (0,1),𝑡 [∥𝜖 − 𝜖𝜃 (𝑧𝑡 , T𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑦′, 𝑣), 𝑡)∥2 2] . (3) The inner maximization aims to update the model parameters to maximize the noise prediction loss, preventing the learned embed- ding from restoring the target concept. However, directly maxi- mizing the loss can significantly impair the model’s capacity in image generation, as also noted in [15]. Thus, we relax the in- ner maximization by introducing ˜𝜖, satisfying ∥𝜖 − ˜𝜖 ∥2 ≥ 𝑑 > Probing Unlearned Diffusion Models: A Transferable Adversarial Attack Perspective xx, xx, xx 0, where 𝑑 is a constant. In the inner maximization, maximiz- ing ∥𝜖 − 𝜖𝜃 (𝑧𝑡 , T𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑦′, 𝑣), 𝑡)∥2 2 is equivalent to maximizing ∥𝜖 − 𝜖𝜃 (𝑧𝑡 , T𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑦′, 𝑣), 𝑡)∥2, which can be rewritten as follows: ‖ ‖𝜖 − 𝜖𝜃 (𝑧𝑡 , T𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑦′, 𝑣), 𝑡)‖ ‖ 2 = ‖ ‖( 𝜖 − ˜𝜖) − ( 𝜖𝜃 (𝑧𝑡 , T𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑦′, 𝑣), 𝑡) − ˜𝜖)‖ ‖ 2 ≥ ‖ ‖𝜖 − ˜𝜖‖ ‖ 2 − ‖ ‖𝜖𝜃 (𝑧𝑡 , T𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑦′, 𝑣), 𝑡) − ˜𝜖‖ ‖ 2 ≥ 𝑑 − ‖ ‖𝜖𝜃 (𝑧𝑡 , T𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑦′, 𝑣), 𝑡) − ˜𝜖‖ ‖ 2. (4) Instead of maximizing the loss itself, we relax it by maximizing its lower bound, which is equivalent to a minimization problem as below: min 𝜃 ‖ ‖𝜖𝜃 (𝑧𝑡 , T𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑦′, 𝑣), 𝑡) − ˜𝜖‖ ‖2 2. (5) Then we need to determine the assignment of ˜𝜖. Naturally, ˜𝜖 should maintain a certain distance 𝑑 from 𝜖 to ensure a large lower bound. In practice, we adopt the following assignment: ˜𝜖 = 𝜖𝜃0 (𝑧𝑡 , T𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑦′), 𝑡), (6) where 𝜃0 is the original model parameters (i.e., parameters before updating), 𝑦′ is token embeddings of a neutral prompt (i.e., \"a photo of\"). Then, the inner optimization becomes: min 𝜃 ‖ ‖𝜖𝜃 (𝑧𝑡 , T𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑦′, 𝑣), 𝑡) − 𝜖𝜃0 (𝑧𝑡 , T𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑦′), 𝑡)‖ ‖2 2. (7) But the above minimization process has a relatively large memory burden, as the attacker needs to make a copy of the model parame- ters (i.e., 𝜃0) before updating. To address this, we use 𝜖𝜃 (𝑧𝑡 , T𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑦′), 𝑡) to approximate 𝜖𝜃0 (𝑧𝑡 , T𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑦′), 𝑡), assuming that the model main- tains the capacity to generate neutral images during parameter updating, which is similar to the assumption in [15]. Then the minimization process can be written as: min 𝜃 ‖ ‖𝜖𝜃 (𝑧𝑡 , T𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑦′, 𝑣), 𝑡) − 𝜖𝜃 (𝑧𝑡 , T𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑦′), 𝑡).sg()‖ ‖2 2, (8) where .sg() represents the stop gradient operation, ensuring that the model’s ability to generate neutral images is not damaged. This minimization process remaps the learned embedding to neutral images, thereby removing the mapping from the embedding to the target concept. It’s important to note that this erasing formulation differs from existing methods. While CA [15] appears to perform erasing in a similar manner, it needs to determine an anchor concept, making it not as general as the approach used here. Strategy Implementation. Then we introduce the process of searching for the transferable embedding for concept restoration, as presented in Figure 2. The attacker begins by collecting some images of the target concept, denoted by 𝑋 = {𝑥𝑖 }𝑁 𝑖=1, where 𝑁 is the total number of images. During the optimization of the embedding, the reference image 𝑥0 is randomly sampled from 𝑋 and input to the im- age encoder to obtain its latent representation 𝑧0 = E (𝑥0). The time step 𝑡 is uniformly sampled from 1 to 𝑇 , where 𝑇 is the total number of time steps. The noise 𝜖 is randomly sampled from a Gaussian distribution. Next, the noised version of 𝑧 at step 𝑡 can be calcu- lated as: 𝑧𝑡 = √ 𝛼𝑡 𝑧0 + √ 1 − 𝛼𝑡 𝜖, where 𝛼𝑡 is a predefined constant for noise addition. The noise prediction loss can be computed as: L𝑣 = ∥𝜖 − 𝜖𝜃 (𝑧𝑡 , T𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 (𝑦′, 𝑣), 𝑡)∥2 2. Then the embedding is updated using gradient descent to minimize L𝑣 while keeping the model Table 1: Comparisons of Different Attack Methods on Di- verse Concepts.

The detailed process of the strategy can be found in Algorithm 1. 4 EXPERIMENTS 4.1 Experimental Setup Implementation Details. The text-to-image model used in this paper is Stable Diffusion (SD) v1.4, chosen due to its widespread adoption in most concept erasure methods [7, 8, 15]. VIT-L/14 [21] serves as the text encoder. We probe the robustness of four repre- sentative erasure methods, namely UCE [8], ESD [7], FMN [39] and CA [15]. These methods were re-implemented using the official code, with detailed hyperparameters provided in the Appendix. Baseline Methods. We compare the restoration performance of the proposed method with three baseline approaches: UnlearnDiff (UD) [41], Ring-A-Bell (RAB) [33], and the Concept Inversion (CI) techniques used by Pham et al. [20]. UD and CI are white-box attack methods. For UD, we employ the ESD erased model for optimization, and for CI, we use the FMN and CA erased model respectively. Metrics. We employ specific classifiers to detect the target con- cept within the generated images. A higher classification accuracy indicates a greater likelihood of the target concept being present in the generated images. Concretely, to assess the restoration of object concepts, we use YOLOv3 [24] to detect broad concepts (e.g., “Dog”) and ResNet-18 [11] trained on ImageNet [3] to identify nar- row concepts (e.g., “English Springer”). For artist style probe, we utilize the classifier provided by [41]. For the probe of NSFW (i.e., nudity) content, we use Nudenet [1] to detect nudity.

The restoration performance of the baseline methods and ours is presented in Table 1 and Figure 4. For broad objects, prompt-level attacks (i.e., UD [41] and RAB [33]) are ef- fective for the restoration, while embedding-level attacks yield stronger results. But for narrow object, prompt-level attacks can not effectively restore the erased concept. This indicates that nar- rower concepts are easier to erase and harder to restore. Although the white-box embedding-level attack [20] can restore narrow ob- ject for the known erasure method, its transferability is limited. Conversely, our black-box method exhibits superior transferability across various erasure methods. Additional restoration results of more objects are provided in the Appendix. Artist Style. We then probe the restoration of artist style. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 5, prompt-level attacks [33, 41] are ineffective for the artist style restoration, and the white-box embedding-level attack exhibits poor transferability to other erasure methods. But ours achieves better performance. Our method’s restoration perfor- mance of more artist styles can be found in Table 2 and Figure 8. NSFW Content. As depicted in Table 1 and Figure 5, regarding the restoration of nudity content, prompt-level attacks are effective for some erasure methods but may fail when applied to specific erasure methods (e.g., UCE). Similarly, the white-box embedding- level attack also falls short in restoring nudity content across all erasure methods. On the contrary, our method demonstrates effec- tive restoration of nudity content across all four erasure methods, with additional qualitative results shown in Figure 9. Identity. Lastly, we probe the restoration of celebrity identity (ID) concepts, which is the most challenging type. From the results shown in Table 1 and Figure 6, we can find that the prompt-level attacks fail to restore the target ID. Additionally, the white-box embedding-level attack [20] is primarily effective against known erasure methods and struggles to transfer to others. In contrast, our approach can still restore the target ID under the black-box setting, demonstrating its strong transferability. We also use the proposed method to restore diverse ID concepts, and the quantitative and qualitative results are shown in Table 2 and Figure 7, respectively.

The embeddings obtained during the optimization process are then fed into various unlearned Probing Unlearned Diffusion Models: A Transferable Adversarial Attack Perspective xx, xx, xx models to generate images. We record the average ID prediction score every 200 epochs to track restoration performance through- out the optimization process. The results are depicted in Figure 10. It is evident that, for most erasure methods, embeddings obtained without AS struggle to restore the target ID. Conversely, with the assistance of AS, the ID prediction score gradually increases. Addi- tionally, embeddings obtained without AS manage to restore the target ID for the model erased by CA, consistent with the findings in Figure 3, where embeddings obtained from SD without AS exhibit significant overlap with those obtained from CA. 5 CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we propose an adversarial search strategy to find the transferable embedding for probing erasure robustness under a black-box setting. This strategy alternately erases and searches for embeddings, enabling it to find embeddings that can restore the target concept for various unlearning methods. Extensive experi- ments demonstrate the transferability of the acquired adversarial embedding across several state-of-the-art unlearning methods and its effectiveness across different levels of concepts, including objects, artist styles, NSFW content, and the most challenging identity. Ethical Statement. Our work is of the utmost importance for content security. Investigating concept restoration enables us to uncover vulnerabilities in existing concept erasure methods. We are committed to further expanding this work to develop more robust concept erasure techniques. REFERENCES [1] P Bedapudi. 2019.

CoRR abs/2310.11868 (2023). https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.11868 A APPENDIX A.1 Implementation Details Hyperparameters of Erasure Methods. This paper investigates four erasure methods. Unified Concept Editing (UCE) [8] directs the target concepts towards the unconditional concept (i.e., “ ”). For Erased Stable Diffusion (ESD) [7], we fine-tune cross-attention parameters (ESD-x) for object, artist style, and identity (ID) erasure over 1000 iterations with a learning rate of 1e-5. For NSFW con- tent erasure, we fine-tune unconditional layers (ESD-u) for 1000 iterations with a learning rate of 1e-5. The negative guidance is set to 1.0 for all concepts. For Forget-Me-Not (FMN) [39], object era- sure involves 50 training steps with a learning rate of 2e-6, identity erasure comprises 35 training steps with the same learning rate, artist style erasure utilizes 35 training steps with a learning rate of 1e-5, and nudity erasure employs a checkpoint provided by [41]. For Concept Ablation (CA) [15], object, nudity, and identity erasure involve 500 training steps with a learning rate of 2e-5, while artist style erasure comprises 200 training steps with a learning rate of 1e-5. Hyperparameters of Restoration Methods. We investigate four restoration methods, consisting of three baseline methods along with the proposed one. For UnlearnDiff (UD) [41], adversarial to- kens are placed at the sentence prefix. For object and identity con- cepts, 3 adversarial tokens are used; for NSFW content and artist style, 5 tokens are employed. Learning rate is 0.01 and weight decay is 0.1. For Ring-A-Bell (RAB) [33], 30 prompt pairs are utilized to ob- tain the concept vector. The length of prompts is 16 and the strength coefficient is 3. For Concept Inversion (CI) [20], the learning rate for updating adversarial embeddings is 0.1, and weight decay is 0.1. For the proposed method, when updating the adversarial embed- ding, the learning rate and weight decay are both set to 0.1. When updating the model parameters, the learning rate is set to 1e-5. Evaluation Details. Broad object (e.g., car) restoration is evalu- ated using YOLOv3 [24] with a score threshold of 0.5 and a Non- Maximum Suppression (NMS) threshold of 0.4. Narrow object (e.g., jeep) restoration is evaluated using the pre-trained ResNet-18 [11] provided by torchvision library. Nudity restoration is evaluated with Nudenet [1] by detecting five types: BUTTOCKS_EXPOSED, FEMALE_BREAST_EXPOSED, FEMALE_GENITALIA_EXPOSED, ANUS_EXPOSED and MALE_GENITALIA_EXPOSED, with a score threshold of 0.6. Restoration of artist styles is evaluated using the model provided by [41], with performance measured by Top-1 ac- curacy. A.2 Additional Results In the manuscript, for the white-box restoration method Unlearn- Diff (UD) [41], we utilize ESD [7] as the known erasure method. Here, we present additional results for UD when UCE [8], FMN [39], and CA [15] are the known erasure methods (i.e., UD (UCE), UD (FMN), and UD (CA)). Similarly, for the other white-box restoration method Concept Inversion (CI) [20], we introduce results when UCE [8] and ESD [7] are the known erasure methods (i.e., CI (UCE) and CI (ESD)). In addition to introducing more variants of base- line methods, we also include more concept examples. Specifically, for objects, we introduce comparison results for “Car” and “Jeep”. Regarding artist style, we include comparison results for “Marc Chagall”, and for celebrity identity, we add the comparison results for “Emma Watson”. The qualitative results for objects restoration are depicted in Figure 11 and Figure 12, while those for artist styles restoration are shown in Figure 13. NSFW restoration results are presented in Figure 14, and celebrity identity restoration results are shown in Figure 15. The quantitative results of all these concepts are presented in Table 3. The proposed method achieves superior restoration performance for each concept across various erasure methods, as evidenced by higher average accuracy, highlighting its enhanced transferability.
