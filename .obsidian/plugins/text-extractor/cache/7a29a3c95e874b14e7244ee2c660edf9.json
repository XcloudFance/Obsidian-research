With the setup above, the index ¢ is analogous to the number of synthetic tokens that the model has generated, and the model’s knowledge is captured by how many ones the matrix M, contains. To make this connection precise, we define the link density (or accuracy) of B[ M |1 | Mo] Acc(M,) = —I—tlILIAZ0] (M) = = where the expectation is taken over the randomness arising from the synthetic data generation pro- cess and not the source documents Dyource. For a matrix M, we use || M][; to denote 3=, , [M; ;|. We use the notation Acc as this is intended to emulate the accuracy on QUALITY test queries studied in the experimental sections (§4 and §5).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
