Data filtering hurts at high compute budget: The ad- vantage offered by data filtering consistently diminishes as we increase our compute budget. Remarkably, be- yond 450M iterations, training on the unfiltered common crawl dataset outperforms that on LAION-filtered data. Why does the same data filtering, which supposedly picks the ‘best’ data, thereby improving performance at low compute, end up hurting performance at high compute?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
